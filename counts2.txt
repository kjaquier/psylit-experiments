                '#love# One was 
 the love of power , and the other was the love of love .' (2), '#face# With her slender , 
 graceful hands she was always stroking the face of some favorite -- it 
 might be only the face of a child , or it might be the face of some 
 courtier or poet , or one of the four Marys whose names are linked with 
 hers -- Mary Livingstone , Mary Fleming , Mary Beaton , and Mary Seton , the 
 last of whom remained with her royal mistress until her death .' (2), '#king# He would be a king of pleasure if he 
 were to be king at all .' (2), '#sort# Napoleon was not the sort of a man to be routed in discussion , but 
 he was most decidedly the sort of man to be bored and irritated by 
 pedantry .' (2), '#son# It was her 
 son who was Napoleon 's son , and who afterward , under the Second Empire , 
 was made minister of fine arts , minister of foreign affairs , and , 
 finally , an imperial duke .' (2), '#man# As a rule , it is the man , and not the woman , who makes the false step ; 
 because it is the man who elects to marry when he is still very young .' (2), '#heart# It was not a heart that responded to emotions readily , but it was 
 a very good - natured heart .' (2), '#world# But in the case of Antony and Cleopatra alone do we find a man flinging 
 away not merely the triumphs of civic honors or the headship of a 
 state , but much more than these -- the mastery of what was practically the 
 world -- in answer to the promptings of a woman 's will .' (1), '#drama# Under his handling it becomes almost a sordid 
 drama of man 's pursuit of power and of woman 's selfishness .' (1), '#people# The people , who may be described as Greek at 
 the top and Oriental at the bottom , were boisterous and pleasure - loving , 
 devoted to splendid spectacles , with horse - racing , gambling , and 
 dissipation ; yet at the same time they were an artistic people , loving 
 music passionately , and by no means idle , since one part of the city was 
 devoted to large and prosperous manufactories of linen , paper , glass , 
 and muslin .' (1), '#palaces# In it were the palaces of the reigning 
 family , the great museum , and the famous library which the Arabs later 
 burned .' (1), '#parks# There were parks and gardens brilliant with tropical foliage and 
 adorned with the masterpieces of Grecian sculpture , while sphinxes 
 and obelisks gave a suggestion of Oriental strangeness .' (1), '#city# Altogether , Alexandria was a city of wealth , of beauty , of stirring 
 life , of excitement , and of pleasure .' (1), '#Cleopatra# Over the country of which Alexandria was the capital Cleopatra came to 
 reign at seventeen .' (1), '#child# He , however , was a mere child of less than 
 twelve , and was under the control of evil counselors , who , in his name , 
 gained control of the capital and drove Cleopatra into exile .' (1), '#girl# Until then 
 she had been a mere girl ; but now the spirit of a woman who was wronged 
 blazed up in her and called out all her latent powers .' (1), '#fascination# One thing , however , she possessed which struck the balance in 
 her favor , and this was a woman 's fascination .' (1), '#enemies# Next morning it became known 
 everywhere that Cleopatra had remained in Caesar 's quarters through the 
 night and that her enemies were now his enemies .' (1), '#moment# This was a crucial moment in Cleopatra 's life .' (1), '#queen# She was queen of Egypt , and she had 
 redeemed her kingdom and kept it by her sacrifice .' (1), '#girl# Henceforth she was no longer a mere girl , nor a woman of the ordinary 
 type .' (1), '#discovery# Signor Ferrero seems to think this 
 fact to be discovery of his own , but it was set down by Plutarch in a 
 very striking passage written less than a century after Cleopatra and 
 Antony died .' (1), '#Antony# The other 
 was Antony , a soldier by training , and with all a soldier 's bluntness , 
 courage , and lawlessness .' (1), '#soldier# He was essentially a soldier , of excellent 
 family , being related to Caesar himself .' (1), '#whole# This was not the whole of Antony .' (1), '#soldier# Joining the 
 Roman army in Syria , he showed himself to be a soldier of great personal 
 bravery , a clever strategist , and also humane and merciful in the hour 
 of victory .' (1), '#doubt# Making all allowance for the exaggeration of historians , there can be 
 no doubt that she appeared to him like some dreamy vision .' (1), '#years# At this time Cleopatra was twenty - seven years of age -- a period of life 
 which modern physiologists have called the crisis in a woman 's growth .' (1), '#girl# She could be the 
 shrinking , modest girl , too shy to reveal her half - unconscious emotions 
 of jealousy and depression and self - abandonment , or a woman carried away 
 by the sweep of a fiery and uncontrollable passion .' (1), '#doubt# These last words are far too strong , and they represent only Ferrero 's 
 personal opinion ; yet there is no doubt that she met every mood of 
 Antony 's so that he became enthralled with her at once .' (1), '#comrade# His heart and soul were 
 given up to Cleopatra , the woman who could be a comrade in the camp and 
 a fount of tenderness in their hours of dalliance , and who possessed the 
 keen intellect of a man joined to the arts and fascinations of a woman .' (1), '#calculation# That there was calculation mingled with her 
 love , no one can doubt .' (1), '#queen# Why should it 
 have lessened his love for her to know that she was queen of the richest 
 country in the world -- one that could supply his needs , sustain his 
 armies , and gild his triumphs with magnificence ?' (1), '#instances# There are many instances in history of regnant queens who loved and yet 
 whose love was not dissociated from the policy of state .' (1), '#kinds# Plutarch quotes Plato as saying that there are four 
 kinds of flattery , but he adds that Cleopatra had a thousand .' (1), '#mistress# She was 
 the supreme mistress of the art of pleasing .' (1), '#general# Cleopatra 's lover once more 
 became the Roman general , and with a great fleet proceeded to the coast 
 of Greece , where his enemy was encamped .' (1), '#Roman# It seems likely that Antony desired to become again 
 the Roman , while Cleopatra wished him to thrust Rome aside and return to 
 Egypt with her , to reign there as an independent king .' (1), '#city# Rome was 
 almost a barbarian city .' (1), '#moment# This was the crucial moment .' (1), '#nothing# For him the world was nothing ; the dark - browed Queen of Egypt , imperious 
 and yet caressing , was everything .' (1), '#everything# For him the world was nothing ; the dark - browed Queen of Egypt , imperious 
 and yet caressing , was everything .' (1), '#prize# Never was such a prize and never 
 were such great hopes thrown carelessly away .' (1), '#hopes# Never was such a prize and never 
 were such great hopes thrown carelessly away .' (1), '#master# After waiting seven days 
 Antony 's troops , still undefeated , finding that their commander would 
 not return to them , surrendered to Octavian , who thus became the master 
 of an empire .' (1), '#dictator# She had made her 
 lover give up the hope of being Rome 's dictator , but in so doing she had 
 also lost the chance of ruling with him tranquilly in Egypt .' (1), '#queen# She was too much a queen in soul to 
 be led in triumph up the Sacred Way to the Capitol with golden chains 
 clanking on her slender wrists .' (1), '#story# modern critics 
 may have Whatever to say concerning small details , this story still remains the 
 strangest love story of which the world has any record .' (1), '#hope# He may 
 be imprisoned , perhaps for life , yet there is always the hope of his 
 release or of his escape ; and some women will be faithful to him and 
 will watch for his return .' (1), '#story# The story is , of course , the story of Abelard and Heloise .' (1), '#truth# It may well be worth our while to clear away the 
 ambiguities and the doubtful points , and once more to tell it simply , 
 without bias , and with a strict adherence to what seems to be the truth 
 attested by authentic records .' (1), '#circumstance# There is one circumstance connected with the story which we must 
 specially note .' (1), '#reasoner# Pierre Abelard was undoubtedly the boldest and most creative reasoner 
 of his time .' (1), '#logician# He was a 
 marvelous logician and an accomplished orator .' (1), '#prelates# Among his pupils were men 
 who afterward became prelates of the church and distinguished scholars .' (1), '#scholars# Among his pupils were men 
 who afterward became prelates of the church and distinguished scholars .' (1), '#founder# He was 
 practically the founder of the University of Paris , which in turn became 
 the mother of medieval and modern universities .' (1), '#mother# He was 
 practically the founder of the University of Paris , which in turn became 
 the mother of medieval and modern universities .' (1), '#figure# He was , therefore , a great and striking figure in the history of 
 civilization .' (1), '#it# Nevertheless he would to - day be remembered only by 
 scholars and students of the Middle Ages were it not for the fact that 
 he inspired the most enduring love that history records .' (1), '#name# If Heloise 
 had never loved him , and if their story had not been so tragic and so 
 poignant , he would be to - day only a name known to but a few .' (1), '#knight# His father the lord of 
 the manor was a knight , ; but Abelard cared little for the life of a petty noble ; and 
 so he gave up his seigniorial rights to his brothers and went forth to 
 become , first of all a student , and then a public lecturer and teacher .' (1), '#picture# Before proceeding with the story of Abelard it is well to reconstruct , 
 however slightly , a picture of the times in which he lived .' (1), '#age# It was an 
 age when Western Europe was but partly civilized .' (1), '#power# There was as yet no single central power .' (1), '#hamlets# The cities were still mere hamlets clustered around great castles or 
 fortified cathedrals .' (1), '#scene# In Paris itself the network of dark lanes , 
 ill lighted and unguarded , was the scene of midnight murder and 
 assassination .' (1), '#schools# There were 
 great schools of theology , but the students who attended them fought and 
 slashed one another .' (1), '#order# Only very slowly was order emerging from sheer anarchy .' (1), '#canon# It must be remembered that though , in a sense , he was an ecclesiastic , 
 he had not yet been ordained to the priesthood , but was rather a 
 canon -- a person who did not belong to any religious order , though he was 
 supposed to live according to a definite set of religious rules and as a 
 member of a religious community .' (1), '#man# He was at once an accomplished man of the 
 world and a profound scholar .' (1), '#nothing# There was nothing of the recluse about 
 him .' (1), '#years# She was only eighteen years of age , yet 
 already she possessed not only beauty , but many accomplishments which 
 were then quite rare in women , since she both wrote and spoke a number 
 of languages , and , like Abelard , was a lover of music and poetry .' (1), '#lover# She was only eighteen years of age , yet 
 already she possessed not only beauty , but many accomplishments which 
 were then quite rare in women , since she both wrote and spoke a number 
 of languages , and , like Abelard , was a lover of music and poetry .' (1), '#daughter# Heloise was the illegitimate daughter of a canon of patrician blood ; so 
 that she is said to have been a worthy representative of the noble house 
 of the Montmorencys -- famous throughout French history for chivalry and 
 charm .' (1), '#representative# Heloise was the illegitimate daughter of a canon of patrician blood ; so 
 that she is said to have been a worthy representative of the noble house 
 of the Montmorencys -- famous throughout French history for chivalry and 
 charm .' (1), '#man# He was naturally a pleasure - loving man of the world , who may 
 very possibly have relieved his severer studies by occasional revelry 
 and light love .' (1), '#inmate# He 
 flattered her uncle and made a chance proposal that he should himself 
 become an inmate of Fulbert 's household in order that he might teach 
 this girl of so much promise .' (1), '#teacher# He was 
 her teacher , and the two spent hours together , nominally in the study of 
 Greek and Hebrew ; but doubtless very little was said between them 
 upon such unattractive subjects .' (1), '#reason# But the two could not be separated ; and , indeed , there was good reason 
 why they should still cling together .' (1), '#Heloise# Oddly enough , it was Heloise herself who objected to becoming the wife 
 of the man she loved .' (1), '#wife# Oddly enough , it was Heloise herself who objected to becoming the wife 
 of the man she loved .' (1), '#bar# She saw that , 
 were he to marry her , his advancement in the Church would be almost 
 impossible ; for , while the very minor clergy sometimes married in spite 
 of the papal bulls , matrimony was becoming a fatal bar to ecclesiastical 
 promotion .' (1), '#marriage# And so Heloise pleaded pitifully , both with her uncle and 
 with Abelard , that there should be no marriage .' (1), '#mistress# She cried out , in an agony of self - sacrifice : 
 " I would rather be your mistress than the wife even of an emperor ! "' (1), '#man# Meanwhile , however , the taunts and innuendos directed against Heloise 
 so irritated Fulbert that he broke his promise of secrecy , and told his 
 friends that Abelard and Heloise were man and wife .' (1), '#wife# " I am no wife , " she said .' (1), '#marriage# They asked her whether she would swear to this ; and , without a moment 's 
 hesitation , this pure and noble woman took an oath that there had been no marriage upon the Scriptures 
 .' (1), '#servant# To carry out his plot Fulbert first bribed a man who was the 
 body - servant of Abelard , watching at the door of his room each night .' (1), '#story# It is a shocking story , and yet it is intensely characteristic of the 
 lawless and barbarous era in which it happened .' (1), '#wife# Heloise could no more be his wife .' (1), '#distrust# It was his distrust that cut her to the heart .' (1), '#light# de Champeaux , so he himself was silenced and put to rout by Bernard of 
 Clairvaux--"a frail , tense , absorbed , dominant little man , whose face 
 was white and worn with suffering , " but in whose eyes there was a 
 light of supreme strength .' (1), '#witness# Never , 
 God is my witness , never have I sought anything in thee but thyself ; 
 I have sought thee , and not thy gifts .' (1), '#one# The letter was a long one , but throughout the whole of it the writer 's 
 tone was cold and prudent .' (1), '#anything# But Abelard knew only too well that not in this life could there be 
 anything save spiritual love between himself and Heloise .' (1), '#abbess# After some years Abelard left his dwelling at the Paraclete , and there 
 was founded there a religious house of which Heloise became the abbess .' (1), '#work# The stones of their tomb in the great cemetery of Pere Lachaise 
 were brought from the ruins of the Paraclete , and above the sarcophagus 
 are two recumbent figures , the whole being the work of the artist 
 Alexandra Lenoir , who died in 1836 .' (1), '#likeness# The figure representing Heloise 
 is not , however , an authentic likeness .' (1), '#husband# But others , like Chateaubriand , have more truly seen in them a pure 
 and noble spirit to whom fate had been very cruel ; and who was , after 
 all , writing to the man who had been her lawful husband .' (1), '#figure# He was a remarkable figure as a philosopher and scholar ; 
 but the world cares for him only because he was loved by Heloise .' (1), '#beauty# Sometimes it is 
 a woman 's beauty that causes the shifting of a province .' (1), '#possessions# Again it is 
 another woman 's rich possessions that incite invasion and lead to bloody 
 wars .' (1), '#longing# However , if we look over these different events we shall find that it 
 is not so much the mere longing for a woman -- the desire to have her as a 
 queen -- that has seriously affected the annals of any nation .' (1), '#stories# There are not many stories that hang persistently about the love - making 
 of a single woman .' (1), '#aid# But for a woman 's whole 
 life to be spent in courtship that meant nothing and that was only a 
 clever aid to diplomacy -- this is surely an unusual and really wonderful 
 thing .' (1), '#thing# But for a woman 's whole 
 life to be spent in courtship that meant nothing and that was only a 
 clever aid to diplomacy -- this is surely an unusual and really wonderful 
 thing .' (1), '#offenses# For 
 England she left herself on record as an arrant liar , false , perjured , 
 yet successful ; and because of her success for England 's sake her 
 countrymen will hold her in high remembrance , since her scheming and her 
 falsehood are the offenses that one pardons most readily in a woman .' (1), '#part# In the second place , it must be remembered that Elizabeth 's courtships 
 and pretended love - makings were almost always a part of her diplomacy .' (1), '#appendage# When not a part of her diplomacy they were a mere appendage to her 
 vanity .' (1), '#flower# To seem to be the flower of the English people , and to be 
 surrounded by the noblest , the bravest , and the most handsome cavaliers , 
 not only of her own kingdom , but of others -- this was , indeed , a choice 
 morsel of which she was fond of tasting , even though it meant nothing 
 beyond the moment .' (1), '#prey# Let us first consider a picture of the woman as she really was in order 
 that we may understand her triple nature -- consummate mistress of every 
 art that statesmen know , and using at every moment her person as a lure ; 
 a vain - glorious queen who seemed to be the prey of boundless vanity ; 
 and , lastly , a woman who had all a woman 's passion , and who could cast 
 suddenly aside the check and balance which restrained her before the 
 public gaze and could allow herself to give full play to the emotion 
 that she inherited from the king , her father , who was himself a marvel 
 of fire and impetuosity .' (1), '#himself# Let us first consider a picture of the woman as she really was in order

 Boleyn should be a gentle , timid maiden would be to make heredity a 
 farce .' (1), '#years# Elizabeth was about twenty - five years of age when she ascended the 
 throne of England .' (1), '#princess# The intrigues and disturbances of the English court , 
 and the fact that she was a princess , made her birth a matter of less 
 account than if there had been no male heir to the throne .' (1), '#heir# The intrigues and disturbances of the English court , 
 and the fact that she was a princess , made her birth a matter of less 
 account than if there had been no male heir to the throne .' (1), '#woman# At any rate , 
 when she ascended it , after the deaths of her brother , King Edward 
 VI . , and her sister , Queen Mary , she was a woman well trained both in 
 intellect and in physical development .' (1), '#beauty# The portrait of her by 
 Zucchero , which now hangs in Hampton Court , depicts her when she must 
 have been of more than middle age ; and still the face is one of beauty , 
 though it be a strange and almost artificial beauty -- one that draws , 
 attracts , and , perhaps , lures you on against your will .' (1), '#lip# If any one will look at the painting by Zucchero he will see how much is 
 made of Elizabeth 's hands -- a distinctive feature quite as noble with the 
 Tudors as is the " Hapsburg lip " among the descendants of the house of 
 Austria .' (1), '#appearance# Such was the personal appearance of Elizabeth .' (1), '#love# And yet it must be noted that while he loved 
 much , it was not loose love .' (1), '#result# Where Henry loved , 
 he married ; and it was the unfortunate result of these royal marriages 
 that has made him seem unduly fond of women .' (1), '#liver# His ardent 
 temperament , therefore , was checked by a certain rational or 
 conventional propriety , so that he was by no means a loose liver , as 
 many would make him out to be .' (1), '#girl# Elizabeth was only a girl of 
 fifteen , yet she was a match for the accomplished courtier in diplomacy 
 and quick retort .' (1), '#match# Elizabeth was only a girl of 
 fifteen , yet she was a match for the accomplished courtier in diplomacy 
 and quick retort .' (1), '#compact# Even Tyrwhitt believed that there was a secret compact between them , for 
 he said , quaintly : " They all sing one song , and she hath set the note 
 for them . "' (1), '#virgin# During 
 this time Elizabeth put aside her boldness , and became apparently a shy 
 and simple - minded virgin .' (1), '#nothing# Surrounded on every side by those who sought 
 to trap her , there was nothing in her bearing to make her seem the head 
 of a party or the young chief of a faction .' (1), '#facts# The life of Elizabeth has been very oddly misunderstood , not so much for 
 the facts in it as for the manner in which these have been arranged and 
 the relation which they have to one another .' (1), '#one# We ought to recollect that 
 this woman did not live in a restricted sphere , that her life was not 
 a short one , and that it was crowded with incidents and full of vivid 
 color .' (1), '#change# But through it all there was a continual change 
 in her environment , though not in her .' (1), '#Bess# Therefore , to most of them she was always the good 
 Queen Bess .' (1), '#peace# More 
 to the point with them were peace and prosperity throughout the country , 
 the fact that law was administered with honesty and justice , and that 
 England was safe from her deadly enemies -- the swarthy Spaniards and the 
 scheming French .' (1), '#fact# More 
 to the point with them were peace and prosperity throughout the country , 
 the fact that law was administered with honesty and justice , and that 
 England was safe from her deadly enemies -- the swarthy Spaniards and the 
 scheming French .' (1), '#Elizabeth# But , as I said , we must remember always that the Elizabeth of one period 
 was not the Elizabeth of another , and that the England of one period 
 was not the England of another .' (1), '#England# But , as I said , we must remember always that the Elizabeth of one period 
 was not the Elizabeth of another , and that the England of one period 
 was not the England of another .' (1), '#something# As one thinks of it , there is something 
 wonderful in the almost star - like way in which this girl flitted 
 unharmed through a thousand perils .' (1), '#woman# Only an undaunted 
 spirit , a scheming mind that knew no scruples , and finally her own 
 person and the fact that she was a woman , and , therefore , might give 
 herself in marriage and become the mother of a race of kings .' (1), '#mother# Only an undaunted 
 spirit , a scheming mind that knew no scruples , and finally her own 
 person and the fact that she was a woman , and , therefore , might give 
 herself in marriage and become the mother of a race of kings .' (1), '#weapon# It was this last weapon , the weapon of her sex , that proved , perhaps , 
 the most powerful of all .' (1), '#years# In 1583 , when she was fifty years of age , she had reached a point when 
 her courtships and her pretended love - making were no longer necessary .' (1), '#question# This is an interesting question .' (1), '#question# It must be remembered that it was not a question of whether Elizabeth 
 desired marriage .' (1), '#appanage# Again , had she married a French prince and had 
 children , England might have become an appanage of France .' (1), '#evidence# There is no particular evidence that she had any feeling at all for her 
 Flemish , Austrian , or Russian suitors , while the Swede 's pretensions 
 were the laughing - stock of the English court .' (1), '#stock# There is no particular evidence that she had any feeling at all for her 
 Flemish , Austrian , or Russian suitors , while the Swede 's pretensions 
 were the laughing - stock of the English court .' (1), '#Englishman# She was too wise to we d a subject ; though , had she married at all , her 
 choice would doubtless have been an Englishman .' (1), '#something# Then , too , the story of Leicester 's marriage with Amy Robsart is 
 something more than a myth , based upon an obscure legend and an ancient 
 ballad .' (1), '#stories# The earl had had such a wife , and there were sinister stories 
 about the manner of her death .' (1), '#Scott# But it is Scott who invents the 
 villainous Varney and the bulldog Anthony Foster ; just as he brought 
 the whole episode into the foreground and made it occur at a period much 
 later than was historically true .' (1), '#fact# There is one interesting fact which goes far to convince us .' (1), '#difference# To the outward eye there was very little 
 difference in her treatment of the handsome and daring nobles of her 
 court ; yet a historian of her time makes one very shrewd remark when 
 he says : " To every one she gave some power at times -- to all save 
 Leicester . "' (1), '#love# This was as near as she ever came 
 to marriage , and it was this love at least which makes Shakespeare 's 
 famous line as false as it is beautiful , when he describes " the imperial 
 votaress " as passing by " in maiden meditation , fancy free . "' (1), '#women# Mary Stuart and Cleopatra are the two women who have most attracted the 
 fancy of poets , dramatists , novelists , and painters , from their own time 
 down to the present day .' (1), '#likeness# In some respects there is a certain likeness in their careers .' (1), '#queen# Each 
 was queen of a nation whose affairs were entangled with those of a much 
 greater one .' (1), '#parallel# There is still another parallel which may be found .' (1), '#heritage# Mary Stuart was born six days before her father 's death , and when the 
 kingdom which was her heritage seemed to be almost in its death - throes .' (1), '#monarch# James V. of Scotland , half Stuart and half Tudor , was no ordinary 
 monarch .' (1), '#Marie# This girl was Marie of 
 Lorraine , daughter of the Duc de Guise .' (1), '#mother# She was fit to be the mother of 
 a lion 's brood , for she was above six feet in height and of proportions 
 so ample as to excite the admiration of the royal voluptuary who sat 
 upon the throne of England .' (1), '#war# There was war between the two countries .' (1), '#Stuart# The child who was born at this ill - omened crisis was Mary Stuart , who 
 within a week became , in her own right , Queen of Scotland .' (1), '#school# It was , indeed , 
 a singular training - school for a girl of Mary Stuart 's character .' (1), '#fetes# There were fetes and 
 tournaments and gallantry of bearing ; yet , on the other hand , there was 
 every possible refinement and variety of vice .' (1), '#refinement# There were fetes and 
 tournaments and gallantry of bearing ; yet , on the other hand , there was

 the eyes of the queen herself .' (1), '#horsewoman# She was 
 a daring horsewoman .' (1), '#poet# She was a poet and an artist even in her teens .' (1), '#judge# She 
 was also a keen judge of human motives , for those early years of hers 
 had forced her into a womanhood that was premature but wonderful .' (1), '#year# And so Mary , at sixteen , wedded the Dauphin Francis , who was a year her 
 junior .' (1), '#wretched# The prince was a wretched , whimpering little creature , with a 
 cankered body and a blighted soul .' (1), '#marriage# It never was a marriage in reality .' (1), '#Queen# Nevertheless , within a twelvemonth 
 the French king died and Mary Stuart was Queen of France as well as of 
 Scotland , hampered only by her nominal obedience to the sick boy whom 
 she openly despised .' (1), '#ruler# For the brief 
 period of a year she was actually the ruler of France ; but then her 
 husband died and she was left a widow , restless , ambitious , and yet no 
 longer having any of the power she loved .' (1), '#woman# Mary Stuart at this time had become a woman whose fascination was 
 exerted over all who knew her .' (1), '#gleam# There was a gleam in her hazel eyes that showed 
 her to be brimful of an almost fierce vitality .' (1), '#mistress# Young as she was , 
 she was the mistress of a thousand arts , and she exhaled a sort of 
 atmosphere that turned the heads of men .' (1), '#queen# Again , she could assume the haughtiness 
 which belonged to one who was twice a queen .' (1), '#sovereign# The first was 
 natural to a girl who was a sovereign in her own right .' (1), '#creature# At eighteen she was a strangely 
 amorous creature , given to fondling and kissing every one about her , 
 with slight discrimination .' (1), '#woman# She was not a woman to yield herself in love 's last surrender unless her 
 intellect and heart alike had been made captive .' (1), '#life# Mary Stuart 's love life makes a piteous story , for it is the life of one 
 who was ever seeking -- seeking for the man to whom she could look up , who 
 could be strong and brave and ardent like herself , and at the same time 
 be more powerful and more steadfast even than she herself in mind and 
 thought .' (1), '#recognition# He was but a few 
 years older than she , and in his presence for the first time she

 of him more favorable than many , and yet it is a picture that repels .' (1), '#virtue# Bothwell , says he , was of a type esteemed by those who pronounce vice 
 to be their virtue .' (1), '#galliard# He was " a galliard , flushed with rich blood , 
 broad - shouldered , square - jawed , with a laugh so happy and so prompt' (1), '#ease# Frankness was his great

 roisterer , but he was very much a man .' (1), '#man# He was undoubtedly a 
 roisterer , but he was very much a man .' (1), '#collector# He was a collector of books and a reader of them

 their new ruler because of her religion and because she loved to 
 surround herself with dainty things and bright colors and exotic 
 elegance .' (1), '#queen# For a time she was indeed a queen .' (1), '#source# Her subtle fascination was her 
 greatest source of strength .' (1), '#land# It was a land of 
 broils and feuds , of clan enmities and fierce vendettas .' (1), '#wooing# It was a hasty wooing , and the queen herself was first of all the wooer .' (1), '#drunkard# The man was a drunkard who came into her presence 
 befuddled and almost bestial .' (1), '#uprisings# The first - fruits of the marriage were uprisings among the Protestant 
 lords .' (1), '#world# To her court in Holyrood 
 came Bothwell once again , and this time Mary knew that he was all the 
 world to her .' (1), '#levity# She showed what the unemotional Scots thought 
 to be unseemly levity .' (1), '#choice# The French poet , Chastelard , misled by her 
 external signs of favor , believed himself to be her choice .' (1), '#evidence# Another favorite , the Italian , David Rizzio , or Riccio , in like manner

 there is no evidence that she valued him save for his ability , which 
 was very great .' (1), '#mother# Darnley held her by the waist while Rizzio 
 was stabbed before her eyes with a cruelty the greater because the queen

 a cry to a lover in the dark .' (1), '#irony# It was the irony of fate that when they had so met it was only to be 
 parted .' (1), '#mother# There she became 
 the mother of twins -- a fact that is seldom mentioned by historians .' (1), '#fruit# These children were the fruit of her union with Bothwell .' (1), '#story# It is a sad story .' (1), '#teaching# But a queen is not as other women ; and 
 she found too late that the teaching of her heart was , after all , the 
 truest teaching .' (1), '#admiration# They absorbed the 
 commerce of the northern seas , and were the admiration of thousands 
 of travelers and merchants who passed through them and trafficked with

 northern Europe .' (1), '#matter# It was no small matter , then , in 1626 , that the loyal Swedes were hoping 
 that their queen would give birth to a male heir to succeed his splendid 
 father , Gustavus Adolphus , ranked by military historians as one of the 
 six great generals whom the world had so far produced .' (1), '#mother# The expectation was wide - spread and intense that she 
 should now become the mother of a son ; and the king himself was no less 
 anxious .' (1), '#boy# When the event occurred , the child was seen to be completely covered 
 with hair , and for this reason the attendants at first believed that it 
 was the desired boy .' (1), '#monarch# Gustavus was in truth a chivalrous , high - bred monarch .' (1), '#heir# He 
 ordered that the full royal salute should be fired in every fortress of 
 his kingdom and that displays of fireworks , balls of honor , and court 
 functions should take place ; " for , " as he said , " this is the heir to my 
 throne . "' (1), '#son# And so from the first he took his child under his own keeping 
 and treated her as if she were a much - loved son as well as a successor .' (1), '#companions# On one occasion the king 
 and the small Christina , who were inseparable companions , happened 
 to approach a fortress they expected where to spend the night .' (1), '#daughter# Gustavus thought for a moment , and then replied : 
 " My daughter is the daughter of a soldier , and she must learn to lead a 
 soldier 's life .' (1), '#queen# This is only one of a score of stories that were circulated about the 
 princess , and the Swedes were more and more delighted with the girl who 
 was to be their queen .' (1), '#girl# Afterward , in writing of her mother , Christina 
 excuses her , and says quite frankly : 
 She could not bear to see me , because I was a girl , and an ugly girl at 
 that .' (1), '#child# Yet she was a most interesting child , with an 
 expressive face , large eyes , an aquiline nose , and the blond hair of her 
 people .' (1), '#nothing# There was nothing in this to account for her mother 's intense 
 dislike for her .' (1), '#woman# Most of them she luckily escaped ; but when she had grown 
 to be a woman one of her shoulders was permanently higher than the 
 other .' (1), '#clamor# Before she was sixteen she had so approved herself that there was a wide - spread 
 clamor that she should take the throne and govern in her own person to her counselors , 
 and especially to the people at large , .' (1), '#nothing# There was nothing distinctly 
 feminine about her .' (1), '#life# Naude , the librarian of 
 Cardinal Mazarin , wrote of her to the scientist Gassendi in these words :

 verified in her , that short is the life and rare the old age of those 
 who surpass the common limits .' (1), '#workman# There is not a cunning workman 
 in these arts' (1), '#sort# But after she began to make her court a sort of home for art and 
 letters it ceased to be the sort of court Sweden was prepared that for .' (1), '#artists# Many of these were illustrious artists

 Bourdelot was her first lover , but there were many others whose names

 retained of her former self was a carelessness that braved the opinion 
 of her subjects .' (1), '#successor# Therefore she chose out her cousin 
 Charles , declared that he was to be her successor , and finally caused 
 him to be proclaimed as such before the assembled estates of the realm .' (1), '#subjects# They were to be her subjects until the 
 end .' (1), '#daughter# The Swedes remembered that Christina was the daughter of their greatest 
 king , and that , apart from personal scandals , she had ruled them well ; 
 and so they let her go regretfully and accepted her cousin as their 
 king .' (1), '#personage# In Rome she was a brilliant but erratic personage , living sumptuously ,

 favor by another Italian , one Sentanelli , who was the captain of her 
 guard .' (1), '#narrative# They were 
 carefully recorded , however , by the queen 's household chaplain , Father 
 Le Bel ; and there is also a narrative written by one Marco Antonio 
 Conti , which confirms the story .' (1), '#testimony# It may be summed up briefly here , because it is the testimony 
 of an eye - witness who knew Christina .' (1), '#letters# In it were letters and other documents , which , 
 with a steely glance , she displayed to Monaldeschi .' (1), '#subject# He fell at the queen 's feet and wept 
 piteously , begging for pardon , only to be met by the cold answer :

 that there was no hope .' (1), '#members# Was she not still queen over all who

 smiled and said :

 popular fancy without reference to their virtues we must go back to 
 Richard of the Lion Heart , who saw but little of England , yet was the 
 best essentially English king , and to Henry V. , gallant soldier and 
 conqueror of France .' (1), '#martyrs# But if you look for something more than ordinary popularity -- something

 cheeses , than there was already a Stuart legend .' (1), '#pretenders# Even had there been 
 no pretenders to carry on the cult , the Stuarts would still have passed 
 into history as much loved by the people .' (1), '#personage# No one could have cared greatly for the first James , but Charles I. was 
 indeed a kingly personage when viewed afar .' (1), '#wife# He was handsome , as a 
 man , fully equaling the French princess who became his wife .' (1), '#cavaliers# Hence , although he sought to make his rule over England a tyranny , 
 there were many fine old cavaliers to ride afield for him when he raised 
 his standard , and who , when he died , mourned for him as a " martyr . "' (1), '#wonder# , what wonder is it that young 
 Charles came back to England and caracoled through the streets of London 
 with a smile for every one and a happy laugh upon his lips ?' (1), '#monarchists# For Englishmen at heart are not only monarchists , but they 
 are lovers of good cheer and merrymaking and all sorts of mirth .' (1), '#lovers# For Englishmen at heart are not only monarchists , but they

 to be no faint - hearted creature .' (1), '#child# Charles was then only a child of twelve , and so his followers did wisely 
 in hurrying him out of England , through the Scilly isles and Jersey to 
 his mother 's place of exile .' (1), '#years# In 1648 , however , when he was eighteen years of age , he gathered a fleet 
 of eighteen ships and cruised along the English coast , taking prizes , 
 which he carried to the Dutch ports .' (1), '#loiterer# When the head of Charles rolled from the velvet - covered block his son 
 showed himself to be no loiterer or lover of an easy life .' (1), '#burgundy# The red blood should become the 
 rich red burgundy ; the sound of trumpets and kettledrums should give way 
 to the melody of lutes and viols .' (1), '#court# And therefore his court , even in exile , was a 
 court of gallantry and ease .' (1), '#exile# To them 
 Charles was no longer a penniless exile .' (1), '#king# He was a king who before long 
 would take possession of his kingdom .' (1), '#state# Portugal was then very far from being a petty state .' (1), '#hand# It was not merely her daughter 's hand that she offered ,

 to be the wife of the Merry Monarch .' (1), '#wife# She was a quaint and rather piteous little figure , she who was destined 
 to be the wife of the Merry Monarch .' (1), '#preparation# It was a too gracious preparation for a very graceless 
 husband .' (1), '#father# Charles , in exile , had already made more than one discreditable 
 connection and he was already the father of more than one growing son .' (1), '#proof# Many persons believe that Charles had married Lucy Walters , just as 
 George IV . may have married Mrs. Fitzherbert ; yet there is not the 
 slightest proof of it , and it must be classed with popular legends .' (1), '#Peg# There was also one Catherine Peg , or Kep , whose son was afterward 
 made Earl of Plymouth .' (1), '#creatures# Lucy 
 Walters and Catherine Peg were very illiterate creatures .' (1), '#sort# In a way it was precisely this sort of preference that made Charles 
 so popular among the people .' (1), '#Rowley# The popular name for him was " Rowley , " or " Old Rowley "-- a nickname 
 of mysterious origin , though it is said to have been given him from a 
 fancied resemblance to a famous hunter in his stables .' (1), '#test# Perhaps it is the 
 very final test of popularity that a ruler should have a nickname known 
 to every one .' (1), '#day# That was a day 
 when national feeling reached a point such as never has been before or 
 since .' (1), '#king# There was the king once more ; and England , breaking through its long 
 period of Puritanism , laughed and danced with more vivacity than ever 
 the French had shown .' (1), '#king# It was the French king , too , who sent him that 
 insidious , subtle daughter of Brittany , Louise de Keroualle --' (1), '#mother# She became the mother of the Duke of Lenox , and

 mistresses .' (1), '#plaything# They called her " Madam Carwell , " and they seemed to have an

 instinct that she was no mere plaything of his idle hours , but was like 
 some strange exotic serpent , whose poison might in the end sting the 
 honor of England .' (1), '#episode# There is a pitiful little episode in the marriage of Charles with his 
 Portuguese bride , Catharine of Braganza .' (1), '#something# There was something about her 
 grace and innocence that touched the dissolute monarch , who was by no 
 means without a heart .' (1), '#seat# The court became more 
 and more a seat of reckless revelry .' (1), '#who# She was told at the same time who this vixen was -- that she was no fit 
 attendant for a virtuous woman , and that her three sons , the Dukes of 
 Southampton , Grafton , and Northumberland , were also the sons of Charles .' (1), '#attendant# She was told at the same time who this vixen was -- that she was no fit

 Southampton , Grafton , and Northumberland , were also the sons of Charles .' (1), '#king# He could be in every sense a king .' (1), '#daughter# She 
 was not the daughter of a Welsh officer , but of two petty hucksters who 
 had their booth in the lowest precincts of London .' (1), '#country# In those days the 
 Strand was partly open country , and as it neared the city it showed the 
 mansions of the gentry set in their green - walled parks .' (1), '#Yard# At one end of 
 the Strand , however , was Drury Lane , then the haunt of criminals and 
 every kind of wretch , while nearer still was the notorious Coal Yard , 
 no citizen dared where go unarmed .' (1), '#school# It was a school for murderers and robbers and 
 prostitutes ; and every night when the torches flared it vomited forth 
 its deadly spawn .' (1), '#product# Nell Gwyn was , in fact , a product of the vilest slums of London ; and 
 precisely because she was this we must set her down as intrinsically a 
 good woman -- one of the truest , frankest , and most right - minded of 
 the history whom of such women has anything to tell .' (1), '#party# Lord Buckhurst , 
 therefore , paid the bill saying that this was the most poverty - stricken party that she had ever 
 met , while Mistress Nell jeered at the other two , 
 .' (1), '#mistress# There came a time when she was known to be a mistress 
 of the king , and she bore a son , who was ennobled as the Duke of St. 
 Albans , but who did not live to middle age .' (1), '#pleasure# Nell Gwyn was much with 
 Charles ; and after his tempestuous scenes with Barbara Villiers , and the 
 feeling of dishonor which the Duchess of Portsmouth made him experience , 
 the girl 's good English bluntness was a pleasure far more rare than 
 sentiment .' (1), '#type# As I have said , she is a historical type of the woman who loses her 
 physical purity , yet who retains a sense of honor and of honesty 
 which nothing can take from her .' (1), '#examples# There are not many such examples , and 
 therefore this one is worth remembering .' (1), '#part# If she could twine her arms about the monarch 's 
 neck and transport him in a delirium of passion , this was only part of 
 what she did .' (1), '#scene# Then there came the death - bed scene , when Charles , in his inimitable 
 manner , apologized to those about him because he was so long in dying .' (1), '#saying# It is an old saying that to every womanly woman self - sacrifice is almost 
 a necessity of her nature .' (1), '#necessity# It is an old saying that to every womanly woman self - sacrifice is almost 
 a necessity of her nature .' (1), '#trait# To make herself of small account as compared 
 with the one she loves ; to give freely of herself , even though she may 
 receive nothing in return ; to suffer , and yet to feel an inner poignant 
 joy in all this suffering -- here is a most wonderful trait of womanhood .' (1), '#sacrifice# Perhaps it is akin to the maternal instinct ; for to the mother , after 
 she has felt the throb of a new life within her , there is no sacrifice 
 so great and no anguish so keen that she will not welcome it as the 
 outward sign and evidence of her illimitable love .' (1), '#beginning# If anything goes wrong with them , they are 
 sure that this is only the beginning of something even worse .' (1), '#woman# In history there is one woman who stands out conspicuously as a type 
 of her melancholy sisterhood , one whose life was full of disappointment 
 even when she was most successful , and of indignity even when she was 
 most sought after and admired .' (1), '#Lecouvreur# This woman was Adrienne Lecouvreur , 
 famous in the annals of the stage , and still more famous in the annals 
 of unrequited -- or , at any rate , unhappy -- love .' (1), '#Couvreur# Adrienne Lecouvreur -- her name was originally Couvreur -- was born toward 
 the end of the seventeenth century in the little French village of 
 Damery , not far from Rheims , where her aunt was a laundress and her 
 father a hatter in a small way .' (1), '#laundress# Adrienne Lecouvreur -- her name was originally Couvreur -- was born toward 
 the end of the seventeenth century in the little French village of 
 Damery , not far from Rheims , where her aunt was a laundress and her 
 father a hatter in a small way .' (1), '#man# Of her mother , who died in childbirth , 
 we know nothing ; but her father was a man of gloomy and ungovernable 
 temper , breaking out into violent fits of passion , in one of which , long 
 afterward , he died , raving and yelling like a maniac .' (1), '#girl# What she had 
 inherited from her mother is , of course , not known ; but she had all her 
 father 's strangely pessimistic temper , softened only by the fact 
 that she was a girl .' (1), '#tub# It was not the wash - tub that made her so , 
 for she had been born to it ; nor was it the half - mad outbreaks of her 
 father , because to her , at least , he was not unkind .' (1), '#outbreaks# It was not the wash - tub that made her so , 
 for she had been born to it ; nor was it the half - mad outbreaks of her 
 father , because to her , at least , he was not unkind .' (1), '#years# Ambition was 
 awakened in her before she was ten years of age , when she began to 
 learn and to recite poems -- learning them , as has been said , " between the 
 wash - tub and the ironing - board , " and reciting them to the admiration of 
 older and wiser people than she .' (1), '#child# Even at ten she was a very beautiful 
 child , with great lambent eyes , an exquisite complexion , and a lovely 
 form , while she had the further gift of a voice that thrilled the 
 listener and , when she chose , brought tears to every eye .' (1), '#elocutionist# She 
 was , indeed , a natural elocutionist , knowing by instinct all those 
 modulations of tone and varied cadences which go to the hearer 's heart .' (1), '#tribute# It is , in fact , a remarkable tribute to Adrienne that in her thirteenth 
 year she excited so much jealousy that 
 they evoked the law against her among the actors of the Comedie .' (1), '#geniuses# Finally , as the other 
 children were not geniuses , but merely boys and girls in search of fun , 
 the little company broke up .' (1), '#mind# Behind the figure on the stage , torn 
 with passion or rollicking with mirth , there must always be the cool 
 and unemotional mind which directs and governs and controls .' (1), '#theory# To some extent it was the theory of Garrick and Fechter and Edwin Booth ; 
 though it was rejected by the two Keans , and by Edwin Forrest , who 
 entered so throughly into the character which he assumed , and who let 
 loose such tremendous bursts of passion that other actors dreaded to 
 support him on the stage in such parts as Spartacus and Metamora .' (1), '#secret# This 
 was the greatest secret of her success ; for , with her , nature rose 
 superior to art .' (1), '#lady# She went into the 
 provinces , in the eastern part of France , and for ten years she was a 
 leading lady there in many companies and in many towns .' (1), '#source# As she blossomed 
 into womanhood there came into her life the love which was to be at once 
 a source of the most profound interest and of the most intense agony .' (1), '#instinct# It was " the profoundest instinct of her being " ; and she once wrote : 
 " What could one do in the world without loving ? "' (1), '#twist# There was a strange twist in her mind .' (1), '#errors# So far she had learned only a sort 
 of feeble cynicism , which she expressed in letters and in such sayings 
 as these : 
 " There are sweet errors I would not venture which to commit again .' (1), '#something# And so she a mere plaything was alternately 
 caressed and repulsed -- ; and yet this was probably all 
 that she really needed at the time -- something to stir her , something to 
 make her mournful or indignant or ashamed .' (1), '#member# In 1717 , when she was in her twenty - fifth year , she 
 became a member of the Comedie Franchise .' (1), '#fashion# She 
 was one of the glories of Paris , for she became the fashion outside the 
 theater .' (1), '#sort# For the first time the great classic plays were given , not 
 in the monotonous singsong which had become a sort of theatrical 
 convention , but with all the fire and naturalness of life .' (1), '#fashion# Being the fashion , Mlle .' (1), '#discontent# Yet Adrienne had learned 
 at least one thing , and that was the discontent which came from light 
 affairs .' (1), '#hero# At this time there came to Paris a man remarkable in his own century , 
 and one who afterward became almost a hero of romance .' (1), '#Maurice# This was Maurice , 
 Comte de Saxe , as the French called him , his German name and title being 
 Moritz , Graf von Sachsen , while we usually term him , in English , Marshal 
 Saxe .' (1), '#Moritz# This was Maurice , 
 Comte de Saxe , as the French called him , his German name and title being 
 Moritz , Graf von Sachsen , while we usually term him , in English , Marshal 
 Saxe .' (1), '#one# Already , though so young , his career had been a strange one ; and it was 
 destined to be still more remarkable .' (1), '#son# He was the natural son of Duke 
 Augustus II .' (1), '#King# of Saxony , who later became King of Poland , and who is 
 known in history as Augustus the Strong .' (1), '#giant# Augustus was a giant in stature and in strength , handsome , daring , 
 unscrupulous , and yet extremely fascinating .' (1), '#mistresses# Many were 
 his mistresses ; but the one for whom he cared the most was a beautiful 
 and high - spirited Swedish girl of rank , Aurora von Konigsmarck .' (1), '#girl# Many were 
 his mistresses ; but the one for whom he cared the most was a beautiful 
 and high - spirited Swedish girl of rank , Aurora von Konigsmarck .' (1), '#master# Exceedingly handsome , Maurice was a master of all the arts that pleased , 
 with just a touch of roughness , which seemed not unfitting in so gallant 
 a soldier .' (1), '#drinker# In private life he was 
 a hard drinker and fond of every form of pleasure .' (1), '#personification# Of her it has been said that she was 
 " the personification of a kiss , the incarnation of an embrace , the ideal 
 of a dream of love . "' (1), '#she# But it was not she who was destined to win and hold the love 
 of Maurice de Saxe .' (1), '#man# Saxe was not the 
 man to hesitate ; while she already , in her thoughts , had made a full 
 surrender .' (1), '#love# It was , indeed , the very first love which in her checkered career was 
 really worthy of the name .' (1), '#events# For nine long years the two were bound 
 together , though there were strange events to ruffle the surface of 
 their love .' (1), '#king# He had the lofty ambition to 
 be a king himself , and he felt the stirrings of that genius which in 
 after years was to make him a great soldier , and to win the brilliant 
 victory of Fontenoy , which to this very day the French are never tired 
 of recalling .' (1), '#princess# Both of these imperial women might well have attracted a man like 
 Maurice de Saxe , had he been wholly fancy - free , for the second of them 
 inherited the high spirit and the genius of the great Peter , while the 
 first was a pleasure - seeking princess , resembling some of those Roman 
 empresses who loved to stoop that they might conquer .' (1), '#love# She is described 
 as indolent and sensual , and she once declared that the chief good in 
 the world was love .' (1), '#Duke# Come what might , Maurice 
 should be Duke of Courland , even though she lost him .' (1), '#his# This incident shows how absolutely she was his .' (1), '#What# What are we -- what ARE we ?' (1), '#what# What are we -- what ARE we ?' (1), '#scenes# But still she could not give him up , nor could he give her up , though 
 there were frightful scenes between them -- times when he cruelly 
 reproached her and when her native melancholy deepened into outbursts 
 of despair .' (1), '#times# But still she could not give him up , nor could he give her up , though 
 there were frightful scenes between them -- times when he cruelly 
 reproached her and when her native melancholy deepened into outbursts 
 of despair .' (1), '#performance# There was to be 
 a gala performance of Racine 's great tragedy , " Phedre , " with Adrienne , 
 of course , in the title - role .' (1), '#times# Those were evil times , when dark deeds were 
 committed by the great almost with impunity .' (1), '#trade# Secret poisoning was a 
 common trade .' (1), '#thing# To remove a rival was as usual a thing in the eighteenth 
 century as to snub a rival is usual in the twentieth .' (1), '#actress# She stubbornly 
 refused , since she believed that to be the greatest actress of her time 
 was not a sin .' (1), '#sin# She stubbornly 
 refused , since she believed that to be the greatest actress of her time 
 was not a sin .' (1), '#world# " Weary and revolting against this death , this destiny , she stretched her 
 arms with one of the old lovely gestures toward a bust which stood near 
 by and cried -- her last cry of passion : 
 " ' There is my world , my hope -- yes , and my God ! '' (1), '#family# Thus , the house of Romanoff , although comparatively 
 young , stands out to the mind with a sort of barbaric power , more 
 vividly than the Austrian house of Hapsburg , which is the oldest 
 reigning family in Europe , tracing its beginnings backward until 
 they are lost in the Dark Ages .' (1), '#parvenus# The Bonapartes , of course , are merely parvenus , and they have had the 
 good taste to pretend to no antiquity of birth .' (1), '#names# In English history there are two great names to conjure by , at least 
 to the imaginative .' (1), '#Plantagenet# One is Plantagenet , which seems to contain within 
 itself the very essence of all that is patrician , magnificent , and 
 royal .' (1), '#name# This is the name 
 of Stuart , about which a whole volume might be written to recall its 
 suggestions and its reminiscences .' (1), '#master# It is almost characteristic of the Scot that , having small territory , 
 little wealth , and a seat among his peers that is almost ostentatiously 
 humble , he should bit by bit absorb the possessions of all the rest and 
 become their master .' (1), '#fool# Nevertheless , his diplomacy was almost as good as that of 
 Elizabeth herself ; and , though he did some foolish things , he was very 
 far from being a fool .' (1), '#presence# In his appearance James was not unlike Abraham Lincoln -- an unkingly 
 figure ; and yet , like Lincoln , when occasion required it he could rise 
 to the dignity which makes one feel the presence of a king .' (1), '#Stuart# He was the 
 only Stuart who lacked anything in form or feature or external grace .' (1), '#uprightness# His son , Charles I. , was perhaps one of the worst rulers that England 
 has ever had ; yet his uprightness of life , his melancholy yet handsome 
 face , his graceful bearing , and the strong religious element in his 
 character , together with the fact that he was put to death after being 
 treacherously surrendered to his enemies -- all these have combined to 
 make almost a saint of him .' (1), '#Englishmen# There are Englishmen to - day who speak of him 
 as " the martyr king , " and who , on certain days of the year , say prayers 
 that beg the Lord 's forgiveness because of Charles 's execution .' (1), '#ruler# King 
 of England and profess to think that the Princess Mary of Bavaria is the 
 true ruler of Great Britain .' (1), '#kings# They feel that the Stuarts were 
 the last kings of England to rule by the grace of God rather than by the 
 grace of Parliament .' (1), '#thing# This sentiment for the Stuarts is a thing entirely apart from reason and 
 belongs to the realm of poetry and romance ; yet so strong is it that 
 it has shown itself in the most inconsistent fashion .' (1), '#adherent# For instance , Sir 
 Walter Scott was a devoted adherent of the house of Hanover .' (1), '#drunkard# He could not see that the man before him was a drunkard and 
 braggart .' (1), '#object# He snatched up a wine - glass from which 
 George had just been drinking and carried it away to be an object of 
 reverence for ever after .' (1), '#Tory# Nevertheless , in his heart , and often in his 
 speech , Scott seemed to be a high Tory , and even a Jacobite .' (1), '#precedents# There are precedents for this .' (1), '#royalist# The Empress Eugenie used often to say 
 with a laugh that she was the only true royalist at the imperial court 
 of France .' (1), '#childless# were 
 childless , the Duke of Kent was urged to marry , so that he might have a 
 family to continue the succession .' (1), '#thing# Her brilliancy and boldness and beauty , 
 and especially the pathos of her end , have made us see only her intense 
 womanliness , which in her own day was the first thing that any one 
 observed in her .' (1), '#Chevalier# To his followers he was the Young Chevalier , the true Prince of Wales ; 
 to his enemies , the Whigs and the Hanoverians , he was " the Pretender . "' (1), '#Pretender# To his followers he was the Young Chevalier , the true Prince of Wales ; 
 to his enemies , the Whigs and the Hanoverians , he was " the Pretender . "' (1), '#deed# It was a daring deed , and the spectacular side of it has been often 
 commemorated , especially in Sir Walter Scott 's Waverley .' (1), '#Scott# It is Scott 
 again who shows us the prince , master of Edinburgh for a time , while the 
 white rose of Stuart royalty held once more the ancient keep above the 
 Scottish capital .' (1), '#king# George II . was a king whom few respected .' (1), '#reason# But precisely here was a reason why Englishmen were willing to put up 
 with him .' (1), '#hesitation# As between him and the brilliant Stuart there would have been 
 no hesitation had the choice been merely one of men ; but it was believed 
 that the return of the Stuarts meant the return of something like 
 absolute government , of taxation without sanction of law , and of 
 religious persecution .' (1), '#soldier# Cumberland was no soldier ; he had been soundly beaten by the French 
 on the famous field of Fontenoy .' (1), '#surprise# For 
 a moment there was surprise .' (1), '#reign# There was a reign of fantastic and fiendish brutality .' (1), '#ruin# When leaving the North in July , he said : 
 " All the good we have done is but a little blood - letting , which has only 
 weakened the madness , but not at all cured it ; and I tremble to fear 
 that this vile spot may still be the ruin of this island and of our 
 family . "' (1), '#battle# Such was the famous battle of Culloden , fought in 1746 , and putting a 
 final end to the hopes of all the Stuarts .' (1), '#story# Such , in brief , was the story of Prince Charlie 's gallant attempt to 
 restore the kingdom of his ancestors .' (1), '#times# For weeks he had only such sleep 
 as he could snatch during short periods of safety , and there were times 
 when his pursuers came within an inch of capturing him .' (1), '#spirits# But never in his 
 life were his spirits so high .' (1), '#sort# It was a sort of life that he had never seen before , climbing the mighty 
 rocks , and listening to the thunder of the cataracts , among which he 
 often slept , with only one faithful follower to guard him .' (1), '#youth# Such a proximity could not fail to stir the 
 romantic feeling of one who was both a youth and a prince .' (1), '#thought# It seems to have been his thought that if she cared for him , then the 
 two might well love ; and he gave her every chance to show him favor .' (1), '#prince# He was a royal prince , the heir to a throne , or else he 
 was a boy with whom she might play quite fancy - free .' (1), '#boy# He was a royal prince , the heir to a throne , or else he 
 was a boy with whom she might play quite fancy - free .' (1), '#thought# A lover he could 
 not be -- so pure and beautiful was her thought of him .' (1), '#days# These were perhaps the most delightful days of all his life , as they 
 were a beautiful memory in hers .' (1), '#memory# These were perhaps the most delightful days of all his life , as they 
 were a beautiful memory in hers .' (1), '#officer# In that war Macdonald became a British officer and served against his 
 adopted countrymen .' (1), '#hope# There

 she first felt the fascination that he still possessed ; but it was an 
 unhappy marriage for the girl when she discovered that her husband was a 
 confirmed drunkard .' (1), '#marriage# She was only nineteen years of age when 
 she first felt the fascination that he still possessed ; but it was an 
 unhappy marriage for the girl when she discovered that her husband was a 
 confirmed drunkard .' (1), '#man# Alfieri was a man of wealth .' (1), '#attendant# In 
 early years he divided his time into alternate periods during which 
 he either studied hard in civil and canonical law , or was a constant 
 attendant upon the race - course , or rushed aimlessly all over Europe 
 without any object except to wear out the post - horses which he used in 
 relays over hundreds of miles of road .' (1), '#model# Sixteen years after her marriage her royal husband died , a worn - out , 
 bloated wreck of one who had been as a youth a model of knightliness and 
 manhood .' (1), '#touch# During his final years he had fallen to utter destitution , and 
 there was either a touch of half contempt or a feeling of remote kinship 
 in the act of George III .' (1), '#Stuart# When Cardinal York died , in 1807 , there was no Stuart left in the male 
 line ; and the countess was the last to bear the royal Scottish name of 
 Albany .' (1), '#drunkard# Here we have seen a part of the romance which attaches itself to the 
 name of Stuart -- in the chivalrous young prince , leading his Highlanders 
 against the bayonets of the British , lolling idly among the Hebrides , 
 or fallen , at the last , to be a drunkard and the husband of an unwilling 
 consort , who in her turn loved a famous poet .' (1), '#Stuart# But it is this Stuart , 
 after all , of whom we think when we hear the bagpipes skirling " Over the 
 Water to Charlie " or " Wha'll be King but Charlie ? "' (1), '#King# But it is this Stuart ,

 leaving their bleeding carcasses upon the floor .' (1), '#men# Among the nobles there were men whose force of character 
 and of mind attracted her inevitably .' (1), '#thing# Chastity was a thing of which the 
 average Russian had no conception ; and therefore it is not strange that 
 Catharine , with her intense and sensitive nature , should have turned to 
 some of these for the love which she had sought in vain from the half 
 imbecile to whom she had been married .' (1), '#Orloff# The one with whom her name has 
 been most often coupled was Gregory Orloff .' (1), '#Russians# He and his brother , Alexis

 another , notes on the Bank of Venice .' (1), '#affair# Yet , after all , this was only a 
 small affair compared with other undertakings with which Potemkin sought 
 to please her .' (1), '#chain# It

 canvas ; but while Catharine was there they were very real , seeming 
 to have solid buildings , magnificent arches , bustling industries , and 
 beautiful stretches of fertile country .' (1), '#man# Potemkin was , in fact , the one man who could appeal with unfailing 
 success to so versatile and powerful a spirit as Catharine 's .' (1), '#thing# And this , according to Balzac , is the thing 
 that woman yearns for most -- a kindred spirit that can understand without 
 the slightest need of explanation .' (1), '#nothing# The names of other men for whom she 
 had imagined that she cared were nothing to her .' (1), '#empress# But perhaps one finds 
 the chief interest of her story to lie in this -- that besides being 
 empress and diplomat and a lover of pleasure she was , beyond all else , 
 at heart a woman .' (1), '#Antoinette# Probably in our own country and in England this will remain the historic 
 Marie Antoinette .' (1), '#fiction# In the first place , it is mere fiction that represents Maria Antoinette

 she was a dumpy , mean - looking little creature , with no distinction

 to consider it only as a critical moment in the history of Marie

 she wore a hat styled a " what - is - it , " towering many feet in height and

 probably an exact likeness of Aaron Burr , with his brilliant gifts and 
 some of his defects .' (1), '#testimony# It is strong testimony to the character of Burr 
 that Mrs. Stowe set out to paint him as a villain ; but before she had 
 written long she felt his fascination and made her readers , in their 
 own despite , admirers of this remarkable man .' (1), '#parallels# There are many parallels , 
 indeed , between him and Napoleon -- in the quickness of his intellect , the 
 ready use of his resources , and his power over men , while he was more

 of his cultured mind .' (1), '#profligate# It

 Aaron Burr .' (1), '#son# There is another curious story which makes Martin Van Buren , eighth

 investment , which , after all , was not a very large one , and place it in 
 a venture in Texas which looked promising .' (1), '#loss# The speculation turned out to

 government .' (1), '#center# In the presence of the great assemblage , where he

 an oracle at court on everything that related to dress and etiquette and

 biographer , since Bulwer - Lytton 's novel Pelham is really the narrative 
 of Brummel 's curious career .' (1), '#Englishmen# These three men -- Nash , Brummel , and Ranelagh -- had the advantage of 
 being Englishmen , and , therefore , of not incurring the old - time English 
 suspicion of foreigners .' (1), '#Frenchman# A much higher type of social arbiter was a 
 Frenchman who for twenty years during the early part of Queen Victoria 's 
 reign gave law to the great world of fashion , besides exercising a 
 definite influence upon English art and literature .' (1), '#d'Orsay# This was Count Albert Guillaume d'Orsay , the son of one of Napoleon 's 
 generals , and descended by a morganatic marriage from the King of

 impressive appearance , and keen intellect , all of which qualities he 
 transmitted to his son .' (1), '#gentleman# Unlike Nash and Brummel , 
 he was a gentleman in every sense , and his courtesy was of the highest 
 kind .' (1), '#Londoner# Who would have supposed that he was destined to become 
 not only a Londoner , but a favorite at the British court , a model of 
 fashion , a dictator of etiquette , widely known for his accomplishments , 
 the patron of literary men and of distinguished artists ?' (1), '#incident# During his firsts visit to London , which has already been mentioned , 
 Count d'Orsay was invited once or twice to receptions given by the Earl

 revived .' (1), '#man# He had been well educated , and in

 love of display became almost a monomania .' (1), '#figure# In London he hung about the green - rooms , and was a well - known figure 
 wherever actors or actresses were collected .' (1), '#love# Such was his love of the 
 stage that he sought to marry into the profession and set his heart on a 
 girl named Mary Campbell Browne , who was very beautiful to look at , but

 marriage at once took place and Mrs. Browne became a countess .' (1), '#restraint# Having 
 now no heir , there was no restraint on his expenditures , and he borrowed 
 large sums of money in order to buy additional estates and houses and to 
 experience the exquisite joy of spending lavishly .' (1), '#age# It was , as Sir Arthur Conan 
 Doyle has said , " an age of folly and of heroism " ; for , while it produced 
 some of the greatest black - guards known to history , it produced also 
 such men as Wellington and Nelson , the two Pitts , Sheridan , Byron , 
 Shelley , and Sir Walter Scott .' (1), '#daughter# Mrs. Maurice Farmer was the daughter of a small Irish landowner named 
 Robert Power -- himself the incarnation of all the vices of the time .' (1), '#law# There was little law in Ireland , ; and not even that which comes from public

 and assembled in his house all sorts of reprobates , with whom he held 
 frightful orgies that lasted from sunset until dawn .' (1), '#nightmare# His wife and his 
 young daughters viewed him with terror , and the life they led was a 
 perpetual nightmare because of the bestial carousings in which their

 a devil than a man .' (1), '#deal# She was a good deal 
 alone , and his attentions gave her entertainment .' (1), '#years# The Countess of Blessington -- to give the lady her new title -- was now 
 twenty - eight years of age and had developed into a woman of great

 trace of her former plainness to be seen .' (1), '#fad# They gave innumerable 
 entertainments , not only to the nobility and to men of rank , 
 but -- because this was Lady Blessington 's peculiar fad -- to artists and 
 actors and writers of all degrees .' (1), '#restless# He might have lived 
 in comparative luxury upon his income ; but he was a restless , eager , 
 improvident nobleman , and his extravagances were prompted by the urgings 
 of his wife .' (1), '#period# She was now verging upon the 
 thirties -- a time which is a very critical period in a woman 's emotional 
 life , if she has not already given herself over to love and been loved 
 in return .' (1), '#life# When she married Lord Blessington her love life had not yet commenced ; 
 and , in fact , there could be no love life in such a marriage -- a marriage 
 with a man much older than herself , scatter - brained , showy , and having 
 no intellectual gifts .' (1), '#call# There was a call within her for something more 
 than she had yet experienced .' (1), '#restless# The earl , her husband , was by nature no 
 less restless ; and so , without knowing the reason -- which , indeed , she 
 herself did not understand -- he readily assented to a journey on the 
 Continent .' (1), '#woman# A vague , 
 indefinable feeling of attraction swept over this woman , who was now a 
 woman of the world and yet quite inexperienced in affairs relating to 
 the heart .' (1), '#years# The girl was less than fifteen 
 years of age .' (1), '#years# Therefore , much against his real desire , yet 
 in order to shelter his relations with Lady Blessington , D'Orsay agreed 
 to the marriage with Lady Harriet , who was only fifteen years of age .' (1), '#marriage# This made the intimacy between D'Orsay and the Blessingtons appear to be 
 not unusual ; but , as a matter of fact , the marriage was no marriage .' (1), '#bride# The unattractive girl who had become a bride merely to hide the 
 indiscretions of her stepmother was left entirely to herself ; while the 
 whole family , returning to London , made their home together in Seymour 
 Place .' (1), '#court# As it was , he was 
 bound fast to her stepdaughter ; and since at that time there was no 
 divorce court in England , and since he had no reason for seeking 
 a divorce , he was obliged to live on through many years in a most 
 ambiguous situation .' (1), '#painter# He was a skilful painter , and 
 he practised his art in a professional way .' (1), '#visitor# The Iron Duke was , in fact , a frequent visitor at Gore 
 House , and he had a very high opinion of Count d'Orsay .' (1), '#book# But of all that she wrote there remains only 
 one book which is of permanent value -- her Conversations with Lord Byron , 
 a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of the brilliant poet .' (1), '#coincidence# It is a curious coincidence that her earliest novel had portrayed the 
 wreck of a great establishment such as her own .' (1), '#claim# This sum of four thousand pounds was only a nominal claim , but it opened 
 the flood - gates for all of Lady Blessington 's creditors .' (1), '#assemblage# There was a large assemblage of people of fashion .' (1), '#Bonapartist# D'Orsay very naturally went to Paris , for , like his father , he had 
 always been an ardent Bonapartist , and now Prince Louis Bonaparte had 
 been chosen president of the Second French Republic .' (1), '#guest# During the prince 's 
 long period of exile he had been the guest of Count d'Orsay , who had 
 helped him both with money and with influence .' (1), '#what# The separation of friends by death is less terrible than the divorce of 
 two hearts that have loved , but have ceased to sympathize , while memory 
 still recalls what they once were to each other .' (1), '#peer# Moreover , he was a peer of the realm , handsome , ardent , and possessing a 
 personal fascination which few men and still fewer women could resist .' (1), '#gambler# His 
 father was a gambler and a spendthrift .' (1), '#poet# He returned to London to become at one leap the 
 most admired poet of the day and the greatest social favorite .' (1), '#thing# Sir Walter Scott said of him : 
 " His countenance was a thing to dream of . "' (1), '#genius# His glorious eyes , his 
 mobile , eloquent face , fascinated all ; and he was , besides , a genius of 
 the first rank .' (1), '#hero# Darkly mysterious stories of his adventures in the East 
 made many think that he was the hero of some of his own poems , such 
 as " The Giaour " and " The Corsair . "' (1), '#slave# I look on them as 
 grown - up children ; but , like a foolish mother , I am constantly the slave 
 of one of them .' (1), '#minister# William Lamb , afterward 
 Lord Melbourne , and destined to be the first prime minister of Queen 
 Victoria .' (1), '#man# He was an easy - going , genial man of the world who placed too 
 much confidence in the honor of his wife .' (1), '#fool# She , on the other hand , was 
 a sentimental fool , always restless , always in search of some new 
 excitement .' (1), '#fate# When she first met Byron , she cried out : " That pale face is my 
 fate ! "' (1), '#wooed# It was not long before the intimacy of the two came very near the point 
 of open scandal ; but Byron was the wooed and not the wooer .' (1), '#blunder# It was a strange blunder for a bridegroom , and one which many regarded 
 at the time as ominous for the future .' (1), '#Byron# He was no longer the Byron of 1815 .' (1), '#man# In his thirtieth 
 year , in fact , he had at last become a man .' (1), '#Teresa# This woman was Teresa , Countess Guiccioli , 
 whom he first came to know in Venice .' (1), '#years# She was then only nineteen years 
 of age , and she was married to a man who was more than forty years her 
 senior .' (1), '#slave# She had thought of love but as an amusement ; yet she now became its 
 slave .' (1), '#difficulties# Nevertheless , there were difficulties which might have been expected .' (1), '#instance# It 
 was an instance of genuine love , a love which purified and exalted this 
 man of dark and moody moments .' (1), '#inspiration# It proved to be 
 an inspiration which at last led him to die for a cause approved by all 
 the world .' (1), '#home# Some time between the year 1866 and that of her death , she is said to 
 have visited Newstead Abbey , which had once been Byron 's home .' (1), '#expounder# When Charles Kingsley was a great expounder of British common sense , 
 " muscular Christianity " was a phrase which was taken up by many 
 followers .' (1), '#phrase# When Charles Kingsley was a great expounder of British common sense , 
 " muscular Christianity " was a phrase which was taken up by many 
 followers .' (1), '#fashions# There are just as many different 
 fashions in thought as in garments , and they come and go without any 
 particular reason .' (1), '#sister# Sensibility was the sister of sentimentality and 
 the half - sister of sentiment .' (1), '#thing# Sentiment is a fine thing in itself .' (1), '#creatures# It is 
 consistent with strength and humor and manliness ; but sentimentality and 
 sensibility are poor cheeping creatures that run scuttering along the 
 ground , quivering and whimpering and asking for perpetual sympathy , 
 which they do not at all deserve .' (1), '#truth# It is , in 
 fact , all humbug , just as sentiment is often all truth .' (1), '#Rousseau# The great prophets of this false god , or goddess , were Rousseau in 
 France and Goethe with Schiller in Germany , together with a host of 
 midgets who shook and shivered in imitation of their masters .' (1), '#figures# Some of them were great figures 
 in literature and philosophy , and strong enough to shake aside the 
 silliness of sensibility ; but others , while they professed to be great 
 as writers or philosophers , are now remembered only because their 
 devotion to sensibility made them conspicuous in their own time .' (1), '#degree# The only thing that actually belonged to them was a 
 high degree of sensibility .' (1), '#thing# And what , one may ask , was this precious thing -- this sensibility ?' (1), '#sort# It was really a sort of St. Vitus 's dance of the mind , and almost of 
 the body .' (1), '#exhibition# This was not an exhibition of love -- or , at least , not necessarily 
 so .' (1), '#thing# It is plain enough that sensibility was entirely an abnormal thing , and 
 denoted an abnormal state of mind .' (1), '#something# In her own time she 
 was thought to be something of a philosopher , and something more of a 
 novelist .' (1), '#Necker# This 
 woman was Anne Louise Germaine Necker , usually known as Mme . de Stael .' (1), '#Stael# This 
 woman was Anne Louise Germaine Necker , usually known as Mme . de Stael .' (1), '#banker# Her father was the Genevese banker and minister of Louis XVI , who failed 
 wretchedly in his attempts to save the finances of France .' (1), '#woman# She set herself to be the 
 most accomplished woman of her day , not merely in belles lettres , but in 
 the natural and political sciences .' (1), '#knowledge# The most she ever achieved was a fair knowledge of many 
 things -- a knowledge which seemed surprising to the average man , but 
 which was superficial enough to the accomplished specialist .' (1), '#stocking# Her revels , as well as her hard studies , had told upon her health , and 
 her mother believed that she could not be at once a blue - stocking and a 
 woman of the world .' (1), '#something# There was something very odd about the relation that existed between the 
 young girl and this mother of hers .' (1), '#prude# The country beauty of Geneva became the prude of Paris , 
 while the quiet , unemotional young Genevese became the light of all the 
 Parisian salons , whether social or intellectual .' (1), '#light# The country beauty of Geneva became the prude of Paris , 
 while the quiet , unemotional young Genevese became the light of all the 
 Parisian salons , whether social or intellectual .' (1), '#woman# The mother was a very beautiful woman .' (1), '#reasons# There are reasons for thinking that Germaine 
 bitterly hated her mother , and was intensely jealous of her charm 
 of person .' (1), '#Mme# It may be also that Mme .' (1), '#place# Moreover , 
 his easy - going ways -- even his punch - drinking and his card - playing -- made 
 him a desirable husband at that time of French social history , the 
 aristocracy wished when to act exactly as it pleased , with wanton license , 
 and when an embassy was a very convenient place into which an indiscreet 
 ambassadress might retire when the mob grew dangerous .' (1), '#deal# " 
 " Napoleon found her to be a good deal of a nuisance , " observes a third .' (1), '#match# de Stael was too wise and witty to 
 be acceptable to Napoleon ; and many women repeated with unction that the 
 conqueror of Europe was no match for this frowsy little woman .' (1), '#treatment# " My dear baron , " said Napoleon , " if your mother were to be in Paris 
 for two months , I should really be obliged to lock her up in one of the 
 castles , which would be most unpleasant treatment for me to show a lady .' (1), '#place# Rome , Vienna , St. Petersburg ; and if she wishes to write 
 libels on me , England is a convenient and inexpensive place .' (1), '#sign# Thus the emperor gibed the boy -- he was only fifteen or sixteen -- and made 
 fun of the exiled blue - stocking ; but there was not a sign of malice in 
 what he said , nor , indeed , of any serious feeling at all .' (1), '#Sand# For the rest , she was an earlier George Sand -- unattractive in person , 
 yet able to attract ; loving love for love 's sake , though seldom 
 receiving it in return ; throwing herself at the head of every 
 distinguished man , and generally finding that he regarded her overtures 
 with mockery .' (1), '#bride# The marriage was made on terms imposed by the middle - aged woman who 
 became his bride .' (1), '#life# Her life was the life of a woman who had , in her own 
 phrase , " attempted everything " ; and yet she had accomplished nothing 
 that would last .' (1), '#scraps# She had a wonderful reputation for her knowledge of history 
 and philosophy , and yet what she knew of those subjects is now seen to 
 be merely the scraps and borrowings of others .' (1), '#passages# Something she did when she introduced the romantic literature into 
 France ; and there are passages from her writings which seem worthy of 
 preservation .' (1), '#subject# " It was the subject , " says Mr. Gribble , " on which she 
 had begun to think before she was married , and which continued to haunt 
 her long after she was left a widow ; though one suspects that the word 
 ' marriage ' became a form of speech employed to describe her relations , 
 not with her husband , but with her lovers .' (1), '#form# " It was the subject , " says Mr. Gribble , " on which she 
 had begun to think before she was married , and which continued to haunt 
 her long after she was left a widow ; though one suspects that the word 
 ' marriage ' became a form of speech employed to describe her relations , 
 not with her husband , but with her lovers .' (1), '#violence# In an unhappy marriage , there is a violence of distress surpassing all 
 other sufferings in the world .' (1), '#isolation# To struggle against fate alone , to journey to the grave 
 without a friend to support you or to regret you , is an isolation of 
 which the deserts of Arabia give but a faint and feeble idea .' (1), '#nothing# When 
 all the treasure of your youth has been given in vain , when you can no 
 longer hope that the reflection of these first rays will shine upon the 
 end of your life , when there is nothing in the dusk to remind you of 
 the dawn , and when the twilight is pale and colorless as a livid specter 
 that precedes the night , your heart revolts , and you feel that you have 
 been robbed of the gifts of God upon earth .' (1), '#existence# Love is woman 's whole existence .' (1), '#episode# It is only an episode in the lives 
 of men .' (1), '#woman# One can not help noticing how lacking in neatness of expression is this 
 woman who wrote so much .' (1), '#opinion# She talked so much that her conversation was almost always mere personal 
 opinion .' (1), '#glimpse# There is an interesting glimpse of her in the recollections of Dr. 
 Bollmann , at the period when Mme .' (1), '#woman# Germaine de Stael , though she was much read and much feted and much 
 followed , came finally to that last halting - place where confessedly 
 she was merely an old woman , eccentric , and unattractive .' (1), '#end# But such is the natural end of sensibility , and of the woman who 
 typifies it for succeeding generations .' (1), '#what# " Not at all , " said he ; " and we have here only a feeble nucleus of the 
 Marx literature -- just enough , in fact , to give you a glimpse of what 
 that literature really is .' (1), '#books# These are merely the books written by Marx 
 himself , and the translations of them , with a few expository monographs .' (1), '#fact# What struck me as most singular was the fact that there was scarcely 
 a volume about Marx himself .' (1), '#volume# What struck me as most singular was the fact that there was scarcely 
 a volume about Marx himself .' (1), '#object# In fact , in the latter 's preface he seems 
 conscious of this defect , and says : 
 Whether socialism proves , in the long span of centuries , to be good or 
 evil , a blessing to men or a curse , Karl Marx must always be an object 
 of interest as one of the great world - figures of immortal memory .' (1), '#biography# Although more than twenty - six years have elapsed since the 
 death of Marx , there is no adequate biography of him in any language .' (1), '#intimation# Here is an admission that there exists no adequate biography of Karl 
 Marx , and here is also an intimation that simply as a man , and not 
 merely as a great firebrand of socialism , Marx is well worth studying .' (1), '#Arms# The 
 motto of this paper is not the Vergilian " Arms and the man I sing , " 
 but simply " The man I sing "-- and the woman .' (1), '#man# The 
 motto of this paper is not the Vergilian " Arms and the man I sing , " 
 but simply " The man I sing "-- and the woman .' (1), '#place# Today , the town is commonplace enough when you pass through it , but when 
 you look into its history , and seek out that history 's evidences , you 
 will find that it was not always a rather sleepy little place .' (1), '#birthplace# Treves , therefore , has a right to be termed imperial , and it was 
 the birthplace of one whose sway over the minds of men has been both 
 imperial and imperious .' (1), '#lawyer# His 
 father , Heinrich Marx , was a provincial Jewish lawyer who had adopted 
 Christianity , probably because it was expedient , and because it enabled 
 him to hold local offices and gain some social consequence .' (1), '#Jew# One of its ablest marshals -- Massena -- was a Jew , and therefore , 
 when the imperial eagle was at the zenith of its flight , the Jews in 
 every city and town of Europe were enthusiastic admirers of Napoleon , 
 some even calling him the Messiah .' (1), '#admirers# One of its ablest marshals -- Massena -- was a Jew , and therefore , 
 when the imperial eagle was at the zenith of its flight , the Jews in 
 every city and town of Europe were enthusiastic admirers of Napoleon , 
 some even calling him the Messiah .' (1), '#Jewess# She was a Netherlandish Jewess of the strictly domestic and conservative 
 type , fond of her children and her home , and detesting any talk that 
 looked to revolutionary ideas or to a change in the social order .' (1), '#Christian# She 
 became a Christian with her husband , but the word meant little to her .' (1), '#irony# As Mr. Spargo says : 
 It was the irony of life that the son , who kindled a mighty hope in the 
 hearts of unnumbered thousands of his fellow human beings , a hope that 
 is today inspiring millions of those who speak his name with reverence 
 and love , should be able to do that only by destroying his mother 's hope 
 and happiness in her son , and that every step he took should fill her 
 heart with a great agony .' (1), '#man# He was a man of genuine rank , and might have 
 shown all the arrogance and superciliousness of the average Prussian 
 official ; but when he became associated with Heinrich Marx he evinced 
 none of that condescending manner .' (1), '#friends# The two men became firm friends , and 
 the baron treated the provincial lawyer as an equal .' (1), '#child# The baron treated Karl as if the lad were a child of his own .' (1), '#mind# His mind was 
 evidently a creative mind , one that was able to think out difficult 
 problems without fatigue .' (1), '#characteristics# Penetration , thoroughness , 
 creativeness , and a capacity for labor were the boy 's chief 
 characteristics .' (1), '#companions# They had been close companions .' (1), '#thing# At night and in the daytime there 
 was just one thing which filled his mind and heart -- the beautiful vision 
 of Jenny von Westphalen .' (1), '#match# She is four years wiser ; and a 
 girl of twenty is , in fact , a match for a youth of twenty - five .' (1), '#persons# Those whom she knew were persons of rank and station .' (1), '#friend# Baron 
 von Westphalen was his old and intimate friend .' (1), '#reply# No matter how eagerly and 
 tenderly he wrote to her , there came no reply .' (1), '#what# She 
 was willing to accept him with what he was able to give her .' (1), '#poems# Luckily , he was wise enough , after a time , to recognize how halting 
 were his poems when compared with those of the great masters ; and so he 
 resumed his restless , desultory work .' (1), '#instructor# He took his 
 degree , and thought of becoming an instructor at the university of Jena ; 
 but his radicalism prevented this , and he became the editor of a liberal 
 newspaper , which soon , however , became so very radical as to lead to his 
 withdrawal .' (1), '#editor# He took his 
 degree , and thought of becoming an instructor at the university of Jena ; 
 but his radicalism prevented this , and he became the editor of a liberal

 brief glimpse of sunshine that was to precede year after year of anxiety 
 and want .' (1), '#intimacy# Most 
 important of all was his intimacy with the poet Heine , that marvelous

 in German literature comparable to Heine .' (1), '#years# His fascinations 
 destroyed the peace of many a woman ; and it was only after many years of 
 self - indulgence that he married the faithful Mathilde Mirat in what 
 he termed a " conscience marriage . "' (1), '#youth# At that time he was a merry , light - hearted youth , a jovial 
 comrade , and one of whom any girl would be proud .' (1), '#sort# But since his long 
 stay in Berlin , and his absorption in the theories of men like Engels 
 and Bauer , he had become a very different sort of man , at least to her .' (1), '#affinities# The two were indeed affinities in heart 
 and soul ; yet for once the cynical poet stayed his hand , and said no 
 word that would have been disloyal to his friend .' (1), '#man# The French 
 government , at the request of the King of Prussia , banished Marx from 
 its dominions ; and from that day until he had become an old man he was

 crushed him to the earth .' (1), '#parallel# There is a curious parallel between the life of Marx and that of Richard 
 Wagner down to the time when the latter discovered a royal patron .' (1), '#victims# Both of them were victims to a cause in which they earnestly 
 believed -- an economic cause in the one case , an artistic cause in 
 the other .' (1), '#matter# The clash between Wagner and his critics was a matter of poetry and 
 dramatic music .' (1), '#classic# In 
 his lifetime he issued a manifesto that has become a classic among 
 economists .' (1), '#cradle# When his

 religious feeling .' (1), '#evil# Though he believed all present government to be an

 only a century or more of effort and of earnest striving can make it 
 plain whether Karl Marx was a world - mover or a martyr to a cause that 
 was destined to be lost .' (1), '#period# The middle part of the nineteenth century is a period which has become 
 more or less obscure to most Americans and Englishmen .' (1), '#stretch# Between these two extremes there is a 
 stretch of history which seems to lack interest for the average student 
 of to - day .' (1), '#period# In America , that was a period when we took little interest in the 
 movement of affairs on the continent of Europe .' (1), '#Englishman# What the Dutchies and Frenchies were doing was little more to 
 an Englishman than to an American .' (1), '#mystery# Continental Europe was a mystery to English - speaking people .' (1), '#being# To

 would presently be regulated , either by the statesmen or by the police .' (1), '#who# If , again , they had been told that Ferdinand Lassalle had joined in the 
 great movement initiated by Karl Marx , it is absolutely certain that

 Jewish silk - merchant .' (1), '#cleverness# Heymann Lassal -- for thus the father spelled his 
 name -- stroked his hands at young Ferdinand 's cleverness , but he meant it 
 to be a commercial cleverness .' (1), '#parent# He was an affectionate 
 parent , and at the same time tyrannical to a degree .' (1), '#story# It was the old story the father wishes where to direct every step that 
 his son takes , and where the son , bursting out into youthful manhood , 
 feels that he has the right to freedom .' (1), '#merchant# Young 
 Lassalle , instead of becoming a clever silk - merchant , insisted on a 
 university career , where he studied earnestly , and was admitted to the 
 most cultured circles .' (1), '#youth# It is not likely that such a keen and cynical observer as 
 Heinrich Heine would have written as he did concerning Lassalle , had not 
 the latter been a brilliant and magnetic youth .' (1), '#man# Heine wrote to Varnhagen 
 von Ense , the German historian : 
 My friend , Herr Lassalle , who brings you this letter , is a young man of

 twice the age of Lassalle .' (1), '#age# In truth , there was no real scandal in the matter , for the countess was 
 twice the age of Lassalle .' (1), '#evidence# There was no evidence 
 against Lassalle ; but his friends fared badly at the trial , one of them 
 being imprisoned for a year and the other for five years .' (1), '#battle# It was a battle fought with the determination of a soldier , with the 
 gallantry of a knight errant , and the intellectual acumen of a learned 
 lawyer .' (1), '#one# It is not surprising that many refuse to believe that Lassalle 's feeling 
 toward the Countess von Hatzfeldt was a disinterested one .' (1), '#devotion# But the very openness and frankness 
 of the service which he did for the countess ought to make it clear that

 affairs such as Heine had ; but they were not deep or lasting .' (1), '#wunderkind# We ought not to be surprised , then , if he was a favorite in 
 drawing - rooms ; if both men and women admired him ; if Alexander von 
 Humboldt cried out with enthusiasm that he was a wunderkind , and if 
 there were more than Sophie Solutzeff to be jealous .' (1), '#advocate# Prince Bismarck , for example , cared nothing for Lassalle 's 
 championship of popular rights , but sought his aid on finding that he 
 was an earnest advocate of German unity .' (1), '#nothing# There was nothing

 dies away in their own throats .' (1), '#spirit# His failure at 
 the moment of her great self - sacrifice had shown him to her as he really 
 was -- no bold and gallant spirit , but a cringing , spiritless self - seeker .' (1), '#trouble# There was some trouble about 
 pistols , and also about seconds ; but finally the combatants left a 
 small hotel in a village near Geneva , and reached the dueling - grounds .' (1), '#thing# Let men

 a great minister of state .' (1), '#minister# She was a wandering actress ; he was

 entertained Peter the Great of Russia ; for having , while young , won 
 the affections of Dorothy Osborne , whose letters to him are charming in 
 their grace and archness ; for having been the patron of Jonathan Swift ; 
 and for fathering the young girl named Esther Johnson , a waif , born out 
 of wedlock , Temple gave to whom a place in his household .' (1), '#education# When Swift first met her , Esther Johnson was only eight years old ; and 
 part of his duties at Moor Park consisted in giving her what was then

 Waring was probably the only girl of refinement who lived near Kilroot .' (1), '#flame# There is a smoldering 
 flame of jealousy running through the letter .' (1), '#intimacy# The true reason for Swift 's utter change of heart is found , no doubt , in

 Johnson .' (1), '#schoolgirl# When Swift left Sir William Temple 's in a huff , Esther had been 
 a mere schoolgirl .' (1), '#years# Now , on his return , she was fifteen years of age , and

 the case .' (1), '#man# He was now a man of mark , because of his ability as a controversialist .' (1), '#moment# When he was 
 about to return to Ireland , there came one startling moment when Vanessa

 be very terrible when angry .' (1), '#eyes# No gleam of pity entered his heart as 
 he leaped upon a horse and galloped out to Marley Abbey , where she was 
 living--"his prominent eyes arched by jet - black brows and glaring with 
 the green fury of a cat 's . "' (1), '#story# Such is the story of Dean Swift , and it has always suggested several 
 curious questions .' (1), '#wife# Why , when he married her , did he treat her still as if she were 
 not his wife ?' (1), '#one# That which was 
 formulated by Sir Walter Scott is a simple one , and has been generally 
 accepted .' (1), '#self# Yet when he 
 met Vanessa he had already gone too far with Esther Johnson to break the 
 bond which had so long united them , nor could he think of a life without 
 her , for she was to him his other self .' (1), '#clergyman# He was a clergyman , and at heart religious .' (1), '#frenzy# The terrible outbreak which brought about Vanessa 's death was

 that perpetual unrest and that frantic fondness for revolt which 
 blazed out in the poet when he was still a boy .' (1), '#squire# His father , Mr. Timothy 
 Shelley , was a very usual , thick - headed , unromantic English squire .' (1), '#daughter# His

 remarkable and powerful character .' (1), '#place# This brought him back to England , and 
 he soon found that England was in reality the place to make his fortune .' (1), '#man# He was a man of magnificent physique .' (1), '#personage# With her wealth he became an important personage , and consorted with 
 gentlemen and statesmen of influence , attaching himself particularly to 
 the Duke of Northumberland , by whose influence he was made a baronet .' (1), '#matter# If any touch of the romantic which we find in Shelley is a matter 
 of heredity , we must trace it to this able , daring , restless , and 
 magnificent old grandfather , who was the beau ideal of an English

 first love - affair .' (1), '#figure# She was rather attractive in appearance , with abundant hair , 
 a plump figure , and a pink - and - white complexion .' (1), '#sort# This description makes 
 of her a rather doll - like girl ; but doll - like girls are just the sort to 
 attract an inexperienced young man who has yet to learn that beauty and 
 charm are quite distinct from prettiness , and infinitely superior to it .' (1), '#listener# She was likewise not a bad listener ; 
 and she would listen by the hour to Shelley in his rhapsodies about 
 chemistry , poetry , the failure of Christianity , the national debt , and 
 human liberty , all of which he jumbled up without much knowledge , but in 
 a lyric strain of impassioned eagerness which would probably have made 
 the multiplication - table thrilling .' (1), '#creature# For Shelley himself was a creature of extraordinary fascination , both 
 then and afterward .' (1), '#likenesses# There are no likenesses of him that do him justice ,

 made to almost every one who met him .' (1), '#features# His eyes and 
 mouth were his best features .' (1), '#voice# The defect in question was his voice .' (1), '#Shelley# Such , then , was Shelley , star - eyed , with the delicate complexion of a

 answer .' (1), '#scene# Some letters that have recently come to light show that there was a 
 dramatic scene between Harriet Westbrook and Shelley -- a scene in the

 shoulder .' (1), '#girl# Yet

 as Claire Clairmont , she and her brother being the early children of 
 Godwin 's second wife .' (1), '#Godwin# " This was Mary Godwin -- one who had inherited her mother 's 
 power of mind and likewise her grace and sweetness .' (1), '#force# It was a great compelling elemental 
 force which drove the two together and bound them fast .' (1), '#nothing# There was really nothing to mar the inner 
 happiness of the poet and the woman who , at the very end , became his 
 wife .' (1), '#wife# There was really nothing to mar the inner 
 happiness of the poet and the woman who , at the very end , became his 
 wife .' (1), '#mother# Living , as they did , in Italy and Switzerland , they saw much of 
 their own countrymen , such as Landor and Leigh Hunt and Byron , to whose 
 fascinations poor Miss Clairmont yielded , and became the mother of the 
 little girl Allegra .' (1), '#union# But there could have been no truer union than this of Shelley 's with 
 the woman whom nature had intended for him .' (1), '#nothing# As the lover and husband of Mary Godwin , there was nothing left to wish .' (1), '#sentence# In his verse , however , the truest word concerning him will always be 
 that exquisite sentence of Matthew Arnold : 
 " A beautiful and ineffectual angel beating his luminous wings against 
 the void in vain . "' (1), '#figure# To most persons , Tennyson was a remote and romantic figure .' (1), '#companion# As a matter 
 of fact , however , he was an excellent companion , a ready talker , and 
 gifted with so much wit that it is a pity that more of his sayings have 
 not been preserved to us .' (1), '#pity# As a matter 
 of fact , however , he was an excellent companion , a ready talker , and 
 gifted with so much wit that it is a pity that more of his sayings have 
 not been preserved to us .' (1), '#pity# On 
 leaving the house , some one said to Tennyson : 
 " Is n't it a pity that such a couple ever married ? "' (1), '#monster# For a moment , Carlyle seemed to have been a monster of harshness , 
 cruelty , and almost brutish feeling .' (1), '#hints# There were hints and innuendos which looked toward some 
 hidden cause for this unhappiness , and which aroused the curiosity of 
 every one .' (1), '#he# It is he who pressed upon the reluctant Froude the duty 
 of printing and publishing a series of documents which , for the most 
 part , should never have been published at all , and which have done equal 
 harm to Carlyle , to his wife , and to Froude himself .' (1), '#amount# There is an extraordinary amount of rather fanciful gossip 
 about this marriage , and about the three persons who had to do with it .' (1), '#deal# His life until that 
 time had been a good deal more than the life of an ordinary country - man .' (1), '#something# There was something in his eye , and 
 in the dominance of his nature , that made his lordly nature felt .' (1), '#clergyman# At that time in Scotland , as in Puritan New England , in each family the 
 son who had the most notable " pairts " was sent to the university that 
 he might become a clergyman .' (1), '#son# If there were a second son , he became an 
 advocate or a doctor of medicine , while the sons of less distinction 
 seldom went beyond the parish school , but settled down as farmers , 
 horse - dealers , or whatever might happen to come their way .' (1), '#advocate# If there were a second son , he became an 
 advocate or a doctor of medicine , while the sons of less distinction 
 seldom went beyond the parish school , but settled down as farmers , 
 horse - dealers , or whatever might happen to come their way .' (1), '#story# That he read all 
 night is a common story told of many a Scottish lad at college .' (1), '#string# One who 
 reads his mocking sayings , or what seemed to be a clever string of jeers 
 directed against religion , might well think that Carlyle was throughout 
 his life an atheist , or an agnostic .' (1), '#atheist# One who 
 reads his mocking sayings , or what seemed to be a clever string of jeers 
 directed against religion , might well think that Carlyle was throughout 
 his life an atheist , or an agnostic .' (1), '#thing# It was a daring 
 thing to do ; but Carlyle had unbounded confidence in himself -- the 
 confidence of a giant , striding forth into a forest , certain that he can 
 make his way by sheer strength through the tangled meshes and the 
 knotty branches he knows that will meet him and try to beat him back .' (1), '#years# Through the kindness of friends , he received some commissions to write 
 in various books of reference ; and in 1824 , when he was twenty - nine 
 years of age , he published a translation of Legendre 's Geometry .' (1), '#friends# The two men were friends , and 
 both of them had been teaching in country schools , where both of them 
 had come to know Miss Welsh .' (1), '#undergraduate# He had 
 won honors at the university , and now , as assistant to the famous Dr. 
 Chalmers , he carried his silk robes in the jaunty fashion of one who has 
 just ceased to be an undergraduate .' (1), '#instructor# While studying , he met Miss Welsh at 
 Haddington , and there became her private instructor .' (1), '#miracle# To read what has been written of her , one might suppose that she was 
 almost a miracle of birth and breeding , and of intellect as well .' (1), '#pares# As a 
 matter of fact , in the little town of Haddington she was simply prima 
 inter pares .' (1), '#doctor# Her father was the local doctor , and while she had a 
 comfortable home , and doubtless a chaise at her disposal , she was 
 very far from the " opulence " Carlyle , looking up at her from his 
 lowlier surroundings , was accustomed which to ascribe to her .' (1), '#doubt# She was , no 
 doubt , a very clever girl ; and , judging from the portraits taken of her 
 at about this time , she was an exceedingly pretty one , with beautiful 
 eyes and an abundance of dark glossy hair .' (1), '#one# She was , no 
 doubt , a very clever girl ; and , judging from the portraits taken of her 
 at about this time , she was an exceedingly pretty one , with beautiful 
 eyes and an abundance of dark glossy hair .' (1), '#intellectuelle# She had become an intellectuelle quite prematurely -- at an age , in 
 fact , when she might better have been thinking of other things than the 
 inwardness of her soul , or the folly of religious belief .' (1), '#herself# Unconsciously , her chief ambition was to be herself 
 distinguished , and to marry some one who could be more distinguished 
 still .' (1), '#figure# He was a striking figure in her small world .' (1), '#man# He was known 
 in Edinburgh as likely to be a man of mark ; and , of course , he had had 
 a careful training in many subjects of which she , as yet , knew very 
 little .' (1), '#suitor# That he did not at once become her 
 suitor is probably due to the fact that he had already engaged himself 
 to a Miss Martin , of whom not much is known .' (1), '#clergyman# Since Irving was a clergyman , and Miss Welsh had not the slightest 
 belief in any form of theology , there was comparatively little that 
 they had in common .' (1), '#paradox# Let her speak 
 to him on any subject , and he would at once thunder forth some striking 
 truth , or it might be some puzzling paradox ; but what he said could 
 never fail to interest her and to make her think .' (1), '#wonder# It is no wonder that Miss Welsh was more and more infatuated with the 
 nature of Carlyle .' (1), '#wish# If it was her conscious wish to marry a man whom she 
 could reverence as a master , where should she find him -- in Irving or in 
 Carlyle ?' (1), '#dreamer# Irving was a dreamer , a man who , she came to see , was thoroughly 
 one - sided , and whose interests lay in a different sphere from hers .' (1), '#fascination# Then , too , there was the fascination of his talk , 
 in which Jane Welsh found a perpetual source of interest : 
 The English have never had an artist , except in poetry ; no musician ; no 
 painter .' (1), '#exceptions# Purcell and Hogarth are not exceptions , or only such as confirm 
 the rule .' (1), '#peasant# Is the true Scotchman the peasant and yeoman -- chiefly the former ?' (1), '#mystery# Every living man is a visible mystery ; he walks between two eternities 
 and two infinitudes .' (1), '#man# Say I am a man , and you say all .' (1), '#appendix# Whether king or tinker is a mere appendix .' (1), '#What# What is it ?' (1), '#answer# To the cui bono 
 there is no answer from logic .' (1), '#lovers# Thus she weighed the two men who 
 might become her lovers , and little by little she came to think of 
 Irving as partly shallow and partly narrow - minded , while Carlyle loomed 
 up more of a giant than before .' (1), '#woman# It is not probable that she was a woman who could love profoundly .' (1), '#pastor# Irving had now gone to London , and had become the pastor of the 
 Caledonian chapel in Hatton Garden .' (1), '#leader# His congregation built for him a handsome 
 edifice on Regent Square , and he became the leader of a new cult , which 
 looked to a second personal advent of Christ .' (1), '#woman# Did she marry Irving , she was 
 certain of a life of ease in London , and an association with men and 
 women of fashion and celebrity , among whom she could show herself to be 
 the gifted woman that she was .' (1), '#nothing# She had the penetration to be certain that whatever Irving might possess 
 at present , it would be nothing in comparison to what Carlyle would have 
 in the coming future .' (1), '#leader# Irving might be the leader of a petty sect , 
 but Carlyle would be a man whose name must become known throughout the 
 world .' (1), '#man# Irving might be the leader of a petty sect , 
 but Carlyle would be a man whose name must become known throughout the 
 world .' (1), '#bride# And so , in 1826 , she had made her choice , and had become the bride of 
 the rough - spoken , domineering Scotsman who had to face the world with 
 nothing but his creative brain and his stubborn independence .' (1), '#gaunt# Froude has 
 described this place as the dreariest spot in the British dominions : 
 The nearest cottage is more than a mile from it ; the elevation , seven 
 hundred feet above the sea , stunts the trees and limits the garden 
 produce ; the house is gaunt and hungry - looking .' (1), '#notion# It was her husband 's notion , and her own , that 
 they should live there in practical solitude .' (1), '#features# These were the two redeeming features of their lonely home -- the presence 
 of Alexander Carlyle , and the fact that , although they had no servants 
 in the ordinary sense , there were several farmhands and a dairy - maid .' (1), '#farmhands# These were the two redeeming features of their lonely home -- the presence 
 of Alexander Carlyle , and the fact that , although they had no servants 
 in the ordinary sense , there were several farmhands and a dairy - maid .' (1), '#period# Before long there came a period of trouble , which is easily explained 
 by what has been already said .' (1), '#work# The most remarkable of his productions was that strange work entitled 
 Sartor Resartus ( 1834 ) , an extraordinary mixture of the sublime and the 
 grotesque .' (1), '#judgment# But now it came forth , as some one has said , " a truth clad in 
 hell - fire , " swirling amid clouds and flames and mist , a most wonderful 
 picture of the accumulated social and political falsehoods which 
 preceded the revolution , and which were swept away by a nemesis that was 
 the righteous judgment of God .' (1), '#jangle# She took to spying on them , 
 and at times , when her nerves were all a jangle , she would lie back 
 in her armchair and yell with paroxysms of anger .' (1), '#man# But when he had grown to be a very old 
 man , he came to feel that this was all a sort of penance , and that the 
 selfishness of his past must be expiated in the future .' (1), '#sort# But when he had grown to be a very old 
 man , he came to feel that this was all a sort of penance , and that the 
 selfishness of his past must be expiated in the future .' (1), '#hint# In one passage there 
 is a hint that certain blue marks upon her arm were bruises , the result 
 of blows .' (1), '#bruises# In one passage there 
 is a hint that certain blue marks upon her arm were bruises , the result 
 of blows .' (1), '#doubt# There is no doubt that Jane 
 Carlyle disliked this brilliant woman , and came to have dark suspicions 
 concerning her .' (1), '#sort# At first , it was only a sort of social jealousy .' (1), '#talker# Ashburton was quite as clever a talker as Mrs. Carlyle , and she had a 
 prestige which brought her more admiration .' (1), '#woman# The greatest source of scandal upon which he drew was a woman named 
 Geraldine Jewsbury , a curious neurotic creature , who had seen much of 
 the late Mrs. Carlyle , but who had an almost morbid love of offensive 
 tattle .' (1), '#sin# She wrote : 
 It is her besetting sin , and her trade of novelist has aggravated 
 it -- the desire of feeling and producing violent emotions ....' (1), '#manifestations# There were strange manifestations on the part of Miss Jewsbury toward 
 Mrs. Carlyle .' (1), '#instances# " There are many other instances of 
 violent emotions in her letters to Mrs. Carlyle .' (1), '#years# It is unusual for a woman of thirty - two to write to 
 a woman friend , who is forty - three years of age , in these words , which 
 Miss Jewsbury used in writing to Mrs. Carlyle : 
 You are never out of my thoughts one hour together .' (1), '#lover# I think of you much 
 more than if you were my lover .' (1), '#yours# I can not express my feelings , even to 
 you -- vague , undefined yearnings to be yours in some way .' (1), '#tatter# Mrs. Carlyle was accustomed , in private , to speak of Miss Jewsbury as 
 " Miss Gooseberry , " while Carlyle himself said that she was simply " a 
 flimsy tatter of a creature . "' (1), '#accusations# But it is on the testimony of this 
 one woman , who was so morbid and excitable , that the most serious 
 accusations against Carlyle rest .' (1), '#sponsor# Thus she is the sponsor of the Ashburton story , in which there is 
 nothing whatsoever .' (1), '#nothing# Thus she is the sponsor of the Ashburton story , in which there is 
 nothing whatsoever .' (1), '#reason# Lord Ashburton always invited Carlyle to his house , and there is no 
 reason to think that the Scottish philosopher wronged him .' (1), '#GOODY# I 
 am ever YOUR OWN GOODY .' (1), '#something# There is something vast , something almost Titanic , 
 about the grandeur and gorgeousness of his fancy .' (1), '#defects# At the same time , there were defects in his intellect and character 
 which are perceptible in what he wrote , as well as in what he did .' (1), '#name# " For , " said the Englishman , " Tom Jim - Jack is a name that could not 
 possibly belong to an English noble , or , indeed , to any Englishman .' (1), '#Who# " Who are you ? " asked he .' (1), '#Englishman# " I am an Englishman , " was the answer , " and naturally I know what names 
 are possible in English . "' (1), '#answer# " I am an Englishman , " was the answer , " and naturally I know what names

 utter contempt .' (1), '#Englishman# " You are an Englishman ; but I -- I am Victor Hugo . "' (1), '#Hugo# " You are an Englishman ; but I -- I am Victor Hugo . "' (1), '#bagpipes# A great many persons 
 told him that the word was " bagpipes , " and not " bugpipes . "' (1), '#Hugo# But he

 Brazil , because he was an emperor ; although Dom Pedro expressed an 
 earnest desire to meet the poet .' (1), '#king# When the German army was besieging Paris , Hugo proposed to fight a duel 
 with the King of Prussia , and to have the result of it settle the war ;

 War Office .' (1), '#daughter# Her name was Adele Foucher , and she was the daughter of a clerk in the

 girl , and was supposed to take no share in the conversation .' (1), '#child# The girl was but 
 a child .' (1), '#warning# Their story is another warning against too early marriage .' (1), '#part# The record of his 
 steady upward progress is a part of the history of literature , and need 
 not be repeated here .' (1), '#Beuve# This intruder was Charles Augustin Sainte - Beuve , 
 a man two years younger than Victor Hugo , and one who blended learning , 
 imagination , and a gift of critical analysis .' (1), '#critic# Sainte - Beuve is to - day 
 best remembered as a critic , and he was perhaps the greatest critic ever 
 known in France .' (1), '#part# It 's a man 's part to try ,' (1), '#lode# This last was not a rich lode , and so he was at

 pains to charge it secretly with ore which he exhumed gloatingly , but

 route was partly ambition , partly sensuality .' (1), '#stain# Hugo are an indelible stain on his memory , and his infamy not 
 only cost him his most precious friendships , but crippled him in every 
 high endeavor .' (1), '#friend# Evidently , though , Victor Hugo could no longer be the friend 
 of the man who almost openly boasted that he had dishonored him .' (1), '#something# But there was something more serious than this .' (1), '#man# He was , as Mr. H.W. Wack well says , " a man of 
 powerful sensations , physically as well as mentally .' (1), '#years# She was then between twenty and thirty years of 
 age , slight of figure , winsome in her bearing , and one who knew the arts 
 which appeal to men .' (1), '#ingenue# For she was no inexperienced ingenue .' (1), '#Mme# The name upon 
 her visiting - card was " Mme . Drouet " ; and by this name she had been known 
 in Paris as a clever and somewhat gifted actress .' (1), '#worship# Theophile Gautier , 
 whose cult was the worship of physical beauty , wrote in almost lyric

 relations ; for , partly out of need , she returned to her Russian 
 nobleman , or at least admitted him to a menage a trois .' (1), '#friend# She became to him , thenceforth , much more than she appeared 
 to the world at large ; for she was his friend , and , as he said , his 
 inspiration .' (1), '#truth# Was there 
 really any truth in the story at which Sainte - Beuve more than hinted ?' (1), '#wife# The other woman had sinned far 
 more ; and yet she had never been Hugo 's wife ; and hence perhaps it 
 was right that she should suffer less .' (1), '#problem# To the student of feminine psychology there is no more curious and 
 complex problem than the one that meets us in the life of the gifted 
 French writer best known to the world as George Sand .' (1), '#task# To analyze this woman simply as a writer would in itself be a long , 
 difficult task .' (1), '#mother# She possessed the 
 maternal instinct to a high degree , and liked better to be a mother

 who was born in 1804 , used afterward to boast that on one side she was 
 sprung from kings and nobles , while on the other she was a daughter

 aristocracy and of the children of the soil , or even of the gutter .' (1), '#aunt# It

 the time she rambled with the country children , learned their games , and

 shock to her , and that with her disposition she might have broken 
 out into wild ways that would have shocked the nuns .' (1), '#student# Her confessor , however , was a keen student of human nature , and 
 he perceived that she was too young to decide upon the renunciation of 
 earthly things .' (1), '#nun# Moreover , her grandmother , who had no intention that 
 Aurore should become a nun , hastened to Paris and carried her back to 
 Nohant .' (1), '#one# There was no one to control her , because her

 be genuine love .' (1), '#will# It proved to be his will , but containing , as a 
 preamble , his curses on her , expressions of contempt , and all the vulgar 
 outpouring of an evil temper and angry passion .' (1), '#hers# At last he yielded , and she went at once to Paris , taking her daughter 
 with her , and having the promise of fifteen hundred francs a year out of 
 the half - million that was hers by right .' (1), '#principle# She wrote : 
 The proprieties are the guiding principle of people without soul and 
 virtue .' (1), '#prostitute# The good opinion of the world is a prostitute who gives herself

 young student and writer named Jules Sandeau , a man seven years younger 
 than his comrade .' (1), '#none# Even before she left her husband , she was credited

 lively passions as mine . "' (1), '#happiness# It is happiness !' (1), '#heaven# It is heaven !' (1), '#doctrine# This was 
 not a new doctrine with her .' (1), '#something# She was 
 not beautiful , though there was something about her which attracted 
 observation .' (1), '#haughtiness# Her address was 
 almost as familiar as a man 's , so that it was easy to be acquainted with 
 her ; yet a certain haughtiness and a touch of aristocratic pride made it 
 plain that she had drawn a line which none must pass without her 
 wish .' (1), '#man# At any rate , so long as he could retain her 
 half - million francs , he was not the man to make trouble about his former

 it only passion ?' (1), '#times# Yet , again , there are times when she feels that he is irritating and 
 ill .' (1), '#poison# She knows , she avows , that 
 she is killing him , that her caresses are a poison , and her love a 
 consuming fire .' (1), '#thought# It is an appalling thought , and Jules will not understand it .' (1), '#death# He laughs 
 at it ; and when , in the midst of his transports of delight , the idea 
 comes to me and makes my blood run cold , he tells me that here is the 
 death he would like that to die .' (1), '#woman# She is 
 by destiny a woman of excessive curiosity , always disappointed , always 
 deceived in her incessant investigation , but she is not fundamentally 
 ardent .' (1), '#woman# Abounding with life , but incapable of long stretches of 
 ardent love , she became a woman who sought conquests everywhere without 
 giving in return more than her temperament made it possible for her to 
 do .' (1), '#reason# Perhaps 
 this is the reason why their romance came to an end abruptly , and not 
 altogether fittingly .' (1), '#theirs# She found him in the apartment that had been theirs , with his arms about 
 an attractive laundry - girl .' (1), '#romance# Thus closed what was probably the only true

 admitted to the French Academy .' (1), '#sort# This life lasted for a while , but it was not the sort of life that 
 would now content her .' (1), '#rival# Returning thither , she is said to have set her cap at Victor Hugo , 
 who was , however , too much in love with himself to care for any one , 
 especially a woman who was his literary rival .' (1), '#touch# He would probably have been better for a 
 plebeian strain , since there was in him a touch of the degenerate .' (1), '#youth# He was an exceedingly handsome youth , with exquisite 
 manners , " dreamy rather than dazzling eyes , dilated nostrils , and 
 vermilion lips half opened . "' (1), '#something# There is something which , to the Anglo - Saxon mind , seems far more absurd 
 than pathetic about the events which presently took place .' (1), '#age# A woman like 
 George Sand at thirty was practically twice the age of this nervous boy 
 of twenty - three , who had as yet seen little of the world .' (1), '#everything# At first she 
 seemed to realize the fact herself ; but her vanity led her to begin an 
 intrigue , which must have been almost wholly without excitement on her

 a curious happening .' (1), '#beginning# What had happened that their arrival in Venice should 
 be the beginning of a quarrel , no one knows .' (1), '#touch# There was a touch of genuine sentiment about the affair with 
 Jules Sandeau ; but after that , one can only see in George Sand a 
 half - libidinous grisette , such as her mother was before her , with a 
 perfect willingness to experiment in every form of lawless love .' (1), '#deal# She was 
 a good deal taken with a noisy demagogue named Michel , a lawyer at 
 Bourges , who on one occasion shut her up in her room and harangued her

 means lustrous ; they reminded me of unpolished marble , or rather of 
 velvet , and this gave a strange , dull , even cold expression to her

 Chopin is the most inconstant of men .' (1), '#nothing# There is nothing permanent about 
 him but his cough .' (1), '#victim# According to some , he was the victim of a Messalina .' (1), '#Messalina# According to 
 others , it was only " Messalina " that had kept him alive so long .' (1), '#volcano# Emotionally , she was an extinct volcano .' (1), '#descriptions# There are many rather pleasant descriptions of her

 follies are titles to glory in the eyes of those whose souls are noble .' (1), '#figure# From 
 his eighteenth year , when he won his first success in journalism , down 
 through his series of brilliant triumphs in fiction , he was more and 
 more a conspicuous figure , living in the blaze of an intense publicity .' (1), '#companion# He met every one and knew every one , and was the companion of every 
 kind of man and woman .' (1), '#member# He loved to frequent the " caves of harmony " which 
 Thackeray has immortalized , and he was a member of all the best Bohemian 
 clubs of London .' (1), '#friends# Actors , authors , good fellows generally , were his 
 intimate friends , and his acquaintance extended far beyond into the 
 homes of merchants and lawyers and the mansions of the proudest nobles .' (1), '#friend# Indeed , he seemed to be almost a universal friend .' (1), '#something# One remembers how 
 Lord Byron 's daughter , Lady Lovelace , when upon her sick - bed , used to

 who kept himself aloof and saw few strangers .' (1), '#Mystery# It is hard to associate anything like mystery with Dickens , though 
 he was fond of mystery as an intellectual diversion , and his last 
 unfinished novel was The Mystery of Edwin Drood .' (1), '#chapter# To be sure , this is a chapter that is writ large in all of his 
 biographies , and yet it is nowhere correctly told .' (1), '#Forster# His chosen biographer

 had become something of a celebrity among the newspaper men with whom he 
 worked as a stenographer .' (1), '#reporter# Then he became a shorthand reporter , and was busy at 
 his work , so that he had little time for amusements .' (1), '#case# It was left to an 
 American to disclose the fact that this was not the case , but that even 
 in his teens he had been captivated by a girl of about his own age .' (1), '#mystery# Inasmuch as the only reproach that was ever made against Dickens was 
 based upon his love - affairs , let us go back and trace them from this 
 early one to the very last , which must yet for some years , at least , 
 remain a mystery .' (1), '#number# The book also contains an introduction by Henry H. Harper , who sets 
 forth some theories which the facts , in my opinion , do not support ; 
 and there are a number of interesting portraits , especially one of Miss 
 Beadnell in 1829 - -a lovely girl with dark curls .' (1), '#woman# Another shows her in 
 1855 , when she writes of herself as " old and fat "-- thereby doing herself 
 a great deal of injustice ; for although she had lost her youthful 
 beauty , she was a very presentable woman of middle age , but one who 
 would not be particularly noticed in any company .' (1), '#thing# It is a dangerous thing to say from whom any character in 
 a novel is drawn .' (1), '#reason# There is little 
 reason to think that the most intimate friends of Dickens and of his 
 family were mistaken through all the years when they were certain that 
 the boy husband and the girl wife of David Copperfield were suggested by 
 any one save Dickens himself and Catherine Hogarth .' (1), '#mother# Why should he have gone back to a mere passing fancy , to a girl who 
 did not care for him , and who had no influence on his life , instead 
 of picturing , as David 's first wife , one whom he deeply loved , whom he 
 married , who was the mother of his children , and who made a great part 
 of his career , even that part which was inwardly half tragic and wholly 
 mournful ?' (1), '#original# Miss Beadnell may have been the original of Flora in Little Dorrit , 
 though even this is doubtful .' (1), '#Mary# It was Mary , however , the youngest of the Hogarths , who lived with the 
 Dickenses during the first twelvemonth of their married life .' (1), '#shock# To Dickens 
 she was like a favorite sister , and when she died very suddenly , in her 
 eighteenth year , her loss was a great shock to him .' (1), '#infelicity# And yet rather early in Dickens 's married life there 
 was more or less infelicity .' (1), '#woman# In his Retrospections of an Active Life , 
 Mr. John Bigelow writes a few sentences which are interesting for their 
 frankness , and which give us certain hints : 
 Mrs. Dickens was not a handsome woman , though stout , hearty , and 
 matronly ; there was something a little doubtful about her eye , and 
 I thought her endowed with a temper that might be very violent when 
 roused , though not easily rousable .' (1), '#something# In his Retrospections of an Active Life ,

 of no influence it had in anything I said or did .' (1), '#disparity# " There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and

 for it .' (1), '#bond# We are strangely ill - assorted for 
 the bond that exists between us .' (1), '#story# In fact , it is the same old story 
 with which we have become so familiar , and which is both as old as the 
 hills and as new as this morning 's newspaper .' (1), '#matter# This arrangement was a private matter , and should not have been brought 
 to public attention ; but it was impossible to suppress all gossip about 
 so prominent a man .' (1), '#companion# By his allusions to a difference of temperament and to incompatibility , 
 Dickens no doubt meant that his wife had ceased to be to him the same 
 companion she had been that in days gone by .' (1), '#nothing# There is nothing strange 
 about their separation , except the exceedingly bad taste with which 
 Dickens made it a public affair .' (1), '#lover# He became a pleasure - lover ; but more than that , he needed one who could 
 understand his moods and match them , one who could please his tastes , 
 and one who could give him that admiration he felt which to be his due ; 
 for he was always anxious to be praised , and his letters are full of 
 anecdotes relating to his love of praise .' (1), '#creature# The 
 companion to whom he clung in his later years was neither a light - minded 
 creature like Miss Beadnell , nor an undeveloped , high - tempered woman 
 like the one he married , nor a mere domestic , friendly creature like 
 Georgina Hogarth .' (1), '#will# I , Charles Dickens , of Gadshill Place , Higham , in the county of Kent ,

 last will and testament .' (1), '#nothing# Yet , look

 combination of Montaigne , Rabelais , and " Uncle Toby . "' (1), '#matter# No one ever did 
 discover just what was the matter , for he seemed well enough in the 
 next few years , basking on the riverside , watching the activities of 
 his native town , and thoroughly studying the rustic types that he was 
 afterward to make familiar to the world .' (1), '#home# he and his 
 parents removed to Paris , which was his home by choice , until his death 
 in 1850 .' (1), '#nothing# In 
 one of his letters to his sister , he wrote : 
 I am young and hungry , and there is nothing on my plate .' (1), '#intimation# This was the 
 first intimation of his " Human Comedy , " which was so daringly undertaken 
 and so nearly completed in his after years .' (1), '#extravagances# " Postage and an omnibus are extravagances that I can not allow myself , " 
 he writes .' (1), '#sentiment# But there 
 was no sickly sentiment between them , and Balzac regarded her with a 
 noble love which he has expressed in the character of Mme .' (1), '#What# What , outside of Balzac himself , could be 
 more terrible than Gobseck , a frightful study of avarice , containing 
 a deathbed scene which surpasses in dreadfulness almost anything in 
 literature ?' (1), '#words# As he read 
 it , there came to him something very like an inspiration , so full of 
 understanding were the written words , so full of appreciation and of 
 sympathy with the best that he had done .' (1), '#effect# It was very largely the effect of these letters that roused 
 Balzac 's full powers and made him sure of winning the two great objects 
 of his first ambition -- love and fame -- the ideals of the chivalrous , 
 romantic Frenchman from Caesar 's time down to the present day .' (1), '#soul# The woman who had become his second soul was not beautiful .' (1), '#quality# Nevertheless , her face was intensely spiritual , and there was a mystic 
 quality about it which made a strong appeal to Balzac 's innermost 
 nature .' (1), '#author# He who wrote the 
 roaring Rabelaisian Contes Drolatiques was likewise the author of 
 Seraphita .' (1), '#what# Thousands of names were considered 
 and rejected , and it was only after his companion , utterly worn out by 
 fatigue , had flatly refused to drag his weary limbs through more than 
 one additional street , that Balzac suddenly saw upon a sign the name 
 " Marcas , " and gave a shout of joy at having finally secured what he was 
 seeking .' (1), '#Marcas# Marcas it was , from that moment ; and Balzac gradually evolved a 
 Christian name for him .' (1), '#one# First he considered what initial was most 
 appropriate ; and then , having decided upon Z , he went on to expand this 
 into Zepherin , explaining minutely just why the whole name Zepherin 
 Marcas , was the only possible one for the character in the novel .' (1), '#maps# An immense table stood in the midst of his study , and upon 
 the top he would spread out the proofs as if they were vast maps .' (1), '#letters# These are very curious letters that Balzac wrote to Mme .' (1), '#egotism# One might think that 
 this was egotism on his part ; but it was more than that .' (1), '#belief# It was a strong

 his time , his home was still a den of suffering .' (1), '#diamond# It must be diamond , not because one would wish to wear it , but 
 because it has had so much use !' (1), '#life# It was at this time that he gave utterance to the poignant 
 cry : 
 Love for me is life , and to - day I feel it more than ever !' (1), '#love# It is only the last love of a woman that can satisfy the first love of a 
 man .' (1), '#proof# It is the most startling proof of his immense vitality , both physical 
 and mental , that so tremendous an emotional strain could be endured 
 by him for years without exhausting his fecundity or blighting his 
 creativeness .' (1), '#period# With Balzac , however , it was the period of his most brilliant work ;' (1), '#caprice# and this was true in spite of the anguish of long separations , and the 
 complaints excited by what appears to be caprice or boldness or a faint 
 indifference .' (1), '#thing# But his one long dream was the only thing for which he cared ; and though

 guest in the countess 's mansion at Wierzchownia ; but finally , in March , 
 1850 , the two were married .' (1), '#What# What is the secret of this strange love , which in the woman seems to be 
 not precisely love , but something else ?' (1), '#secret# What is the secret of this strange love , which in the woman seems to be

 " She Stoops to Conquer " or Sheridan 's " School for Scandal . "' (1), '#son# He was the son of a country gentleman , the lord of a manor which had 
 been held by his family before the Wars of the Boses .' (1), '#justice# His grandfather had married the daughter of a village blacksmith , and

 Bohemian -- a man who could be both rough and tender , and whose boisterous 
 ways never concealed his warm heart .' (1), '#Wilberforce# One of them was Samuel Wilberforce , afterward Bishop of Oxford ,

 hundred dollars annually , and it gave him possession of a suite of rooms 
 free of any charge .' (1), '#temptation# There was the further temptation that the possession of his fellowship 
 did not even necessitate his living at Oxford .' (1), '#while# Reade remained a while at Oxford , studying books and men -- especially the 
 latter .' (1), '#player# He loved the boat - races on the river ; he was a prodigious 
 cricket - player , and one of the best bowlers of his time .' (1), '#fellow# Dancing , 
 indeed , was another of his diversions , and , in spite of the fact that he 
 was a fellow of Magdalen and a D.C.L. of Oxford , he was always ready to 
 caper and to display the new steps .' (1), '#theater# But it was the theater that interested him most .' (1), '#writer# Nothing else seemed to 
 him quite so fine as to be a successful writer for the stage .' (1), '#moment# It was not a fortunate moment for dramatic writers .' (1), '#situation# Such was the situation .' (1), '#one# He had a play entitled " Christie Johnstone , " 
 he believed which to be a great one , though no manager would venture

 management of Buckstone ; and this visit proved to be the turning - point 
 in Reade 's whole life .' (1), '#point# The actress he

 practise and with a good income , every penny of which he spent .' (1), '#Bohemian# She was a true Bohemian , a 
 happy - go - lucky type of the actors of her time .' (1), '#beginning# It was the beginning of a sort of 
 courtship ; and after a while she married him .' (1), '#sentiment# There was no sentiment about it ; but she made him a 
 good wife , and gave no further cause for gossip .' (1), '#woman# Such was the woman whom Charles Reade now approached with the request 
 that she would let him read to her a portion of his play .' (1), '#genius# He had seen 
 her act , and he honestly believed her to be a dramatic genius of the 
 first order .' (1), '#actress# Few others shared this belief ; but she was generally 
 thought of as a competent , though by no means brilliant , actress .' (1), '#youth# His bashfulness led her to suppose that he was 
 an inexperienced youth .' (1), '#son# Little did she imagine that he was the son of a 
 landed proprietor , a fellow of one of Oxford 's noblest colleges , and one 
 with friends far higher in the world than herself .' (1), '#president# He said : 
 " I , who had been vice - president of Magdalen -- I , who flattered myself I 
 was coming to the fore as a dramatist -- to have a five - pound note flung 
 at my head , like a ticket for soup to a pauper , or a bone to a dog , and 
 by an actress , too !' (1), '#virtue# Yet she said my reading was admirable ; and , after 
 all , there is much virtue in a five - pound note .' (1), '#suggestion# Oddly enough , Mrs. Seymour 's suggestion that Reade should make a story 
 of his play was a suggestion which he actually followed .' (1), '#chapter# It is 
 the chapter wherein Reade also draws his own portrait in the character 
 of Francis Bolfe :' (1), '#paper# The room was rather long , low , and nondescript ; scarlet flock paper ; 
 curtains and sofas , green Utrecht velvet ; woodwork and pillars , 
 white and gold ; two windows looking on the street ; at the other end

 hidden by heavy curtains of the same color and material as the others .' (1), '#window# Then she opened two more 
 glass folding - doors , and ushered them into an empty room , the like 
 of which Lady Bassett had never seen ; it was large in itself , and 
 multiplied tenfold by great mirrors from floor to ceiling , with no 
 frames but a narrow oak beading ; opposite her , on entering , was a bay 
 window , all plate glass , the central panes of which opened , like doors , 
 upon a pretty little garden that glowed with color , and was backed by 
 fine trees belonging to the nation ; for this garden ran up to the wall 
 of Hyde Park .' (1), '#head# He was rather tall , very portly , smallish head , commonplace 
 features , mild brown eye not very bright , short beard , and wore a suit

 there was nothing to conceal .' (1), '#nothing# There was no concealment , and apparently 
 there was nothing to conceal .' (1), '#man# He , on his side , often spoke of her 
 by her last name as " Seymour , " precisely as if she had been a man .' (1), '#woman# One 
 of his relatives rather acutely remarked about her that she was not a 
 woman of sentiment at all , but had a genius for friendship ; and that she 
 probably could not have really loved any man at all .' (1), '#explanation# This is , perhaps , the explanation of their intimacy .' (1), '#instance# If so , it is a very 
 remarkable instance of Platonic friendship .' (1), '#burden# When she died , five

 member of a religious community .' (2), '#coffin# In 1858 a coffin which was thought to be 
 the coffin of the earl was opened , and a Danish artist sketched the

 ill - fated Scottish noble .' (2), '#it# In King William 's case it was explained that the dampness of the

 the top and Oriental at the bottom , were boisterous and pleasure - loving , 
 devoted to splendid spectacles , with horse - racing , gambling , and 
 dissipation ; yet at the same time they were an artistic people , loving 
 music passionately , and by no means idle , since one part of the city was 
 devoted to large and prosperous manufactories of linen , paper , glass ,

 were matched by her own subtlety and appealing charm .' (1), '#he# These last words are far too strong , and they represent only Ferrero 's 
 personal opinion ; yet there is no doubt that she met every mood of

 whose love was not dissociated from the policy of state .' (1), '#Antony# In this time Antony was 
 separated from her only during a campaign in the East .' (1), '#stories# Many stories are told of their good fellowship 
 and close intimacy .' (1), '#they# In fact , more than once they were set upon in

 be imprisoned , perhaps for life , yet there is always the hope of his 
 release or of his escape ; and some women will be faithful to him and 
 will watch for his return .' (1), '#annals# The annals of emotion record only one 
 such instance ; and so this instance has become known to all , and has 
 been cherished for nearly a thousand years .' (1), '#she# It involves the story of a 
 woman who did love , perhaps , as no one ever loved before or since ; for 
 she was subjected to this cruel test , and she met the test not alone 
 completely , but triumphantly and almost fiercely .' (1), '#times# It has many 
 times been falsely told .' (1), '#Portions# Portions of it have been omitted , and other

 he had not yet been ordained to the priesthood , but was rather a 
 canon -- a person who did not belong to any religious order , though he was 
 supposed to live according to a definite set of religious rules and as a 
 member of a religious community .' (1), '#he# It was soon after his thirty - fifth year that he returned to Paris , where 
 he was welcomed by thousands .' (1), '#he# It was at this time that he became acquainted with a very beautiful 
 young girl named Heloise .' (1), '#she# Heloise was the illegitimate daughter of a canon of patrician blood ; so

 charm .' (1), '#offer# Such an offer coming from so brilliant a 
 man was joyfully accepted .' (1), '#pleasures# It was then that the pleasures of knowledge , the joys of thought , the

 heart which had never known either love or sorrow ....' (1), '#heart# It was not long before the girl 's heart had been wholly won .' (1), '#poems# Some poems written to Heloise by Abelard , as if in letters of fire , were 
 found and shown to Fulbert , who , until this time , had suspected nothing .' (1), '#who# There , 
 presently , the young girl gave birth to a son , who was named Astrolabe , 
 after an instrument used by astronomers , since both the father and 
 the mother felt that the offspring of so great a love should have no 
 ordinary name .' (1), '#pair# He insisted that the pair should at once 
 be married .' (1), '#weakness# Here was revealed a certain weakness in the character of

 rude hovels , built by his scholars for their shelter .' (1), '#they# It has been 
 said that the letters are not genuine , and they must be read with this

 Heloise herself could have flung a human soul into such frankly 
 passionate utterances , or that any imitator could have done the work .' (1), '#body# Abelard died while on his way to Rome , whither he was journeying

 mingled .' (1), '#stones# The stones of their tomb in the great cemetery of Pere Lachaise 
 were brought from the ruins of the Paraclete , and above the sarcophagus 
 are two recumbent figures , the whole being the work of the artist

 to Pere Lachaise from the ancient College de Beauvais .' (1), '#letters# The letters of Heloise have been read and imitated throughout the whole 
 of the last nine centuries .' (1), '#Romance# Some of the most famous imitations of her letters are those in the 
 ancient poem entitled , " The Romance of the Rose , " written by Jean de 
 Meung , in the thirteenth century ; and in modern times her first letter 
 was paraphrased by Alexander Pope , and in French by Colardeau .' (1), '#he# He was a remarkable figure as a philosopher and scholar ; 
 but the world cares for him only because he was loved by Heloise .' (1), '#marriages# Most royal marriages are made either to 
 secure the succession to a throne by a legitimate line of heirs or else 
 to unite adjoining states and make a powerful kingdom out of two that 
 are less powerful .' (1), '#wives# But , as a rule , kings have found greater delight in 
 some sheltered bower remote from courts than in the castled halls and 
 well - cared - for nooks where their own wives and children have been reared 
 with all the appurtenances of legitimacy .' (1), '#life# But for a woman 's whole 
 life to be spent in courtship that meant nothing and that was only a 
 clever aid to diplomacy -- this is surely an unusual and really wonderful 
 thing .' (1), '#woman# It is the more unusual because the woman herself was not intended by 
 nature to be wasted upon the cold and cheerless sport of chancellors 
 and counselors and men who had no thought of her except to use her as 
 a pawn .' (1), '#nature# It is the more unusual because the woman herself was not intended by 
 nature to be wasted upon the cold and cheerless sport of chancellors

 and pretended love - makings were almost always a part of her diplomacy .' (1), '#love# Finally , though at times she could be very cold , and though she made 
 herself still colder in order that she might play fast and loose with 
 foreign suitors who played fast and loose with her -- the King of 
 Spain , the Duc d'Alencon , brother of the French king , with an Austrian 
 archduke , with a magnificent barbarian prince of Muscovy , with Eric of 
 Sweden , or any other Scandinavian suitor -- she felt a woman 's need for 
 some nearer and more tender association to which she might give freer 
 play and in which she might feel those deeper emotions without the 
 danger that arises when love is mingled with diplomacy .' (1), '#date# It is odd that the date of her birth can not be given 
 with precision .' (1), '#who# It is interesting to compare this painting with the frank word - picture 
 of a certain German agent who was sent to England by his emperor , and 
 who seems to have been greatly fascinated by Queen Elizabeth .' (1), '#orders# She summons Parliament , but lets them know 
 that her orders must be obeyed in any case .' (1), '#they# These were ungloved , and were very long and white , and she 
 looked at them and played with them a great deal ; and , indeed , 
 they justified the admiration with which they were regarded by her 
 flatterers .' (1), '#It# It has been said that Elizabeth inherited many

 made his reign memorable .' (1), '#it# And yet it must be noted that while he loved 
 much , it was not loose love .' (1), '#temperament# His ardent 
 temperament , therefore , was checked by a certain rational or 
 conventional propriety , so that he was by no means a loose liver , as 
 many would make him out to be .' (1), '#antics# The antics she performed with him in her 
 dressing - room were made the subject of an official inquiry ; yet it came 
 out that while Elizabeth was less than sixteen , and Lord Thomas was very 
 much her senior , his wife was with him on his visits to the chamber of 
 the princess .' (1), '#Tyrwhitt# Sir Robert Tyrwhitt and his wife were also sent to question her , 
 Tyrwhitt had a keen mind and one well trained to cope with any other 's 
 wit in this sort of cross - examination .' (1), '#He# He was sent down to worm out of her everything that 
 she knew .' (1), '#Threats# Threats and flattery and forged letters and false confessions 
 were tried on her ; but they were tried in vain .' (1), '#they# Threats and flattery and forged letters and false confessions

 Elizabeth become queen than she knighted the man Parry and made him 
 treasurer of the household , while Mrs. Ashley , the governess , was 
 treated with great consideration .' (1), '#it# We ought to recollect that 
 this woman did not live in a restricted sphere , that her life was not 
 a short one , and that it was crowded with incidents and full of vivid 
 color .' (1), '#queen# What mattered it to the ditcher and yeoman , far from the 
 court , that the queen was said to dance in her nightdress and to swear 
 like a trooper ?' (1), '#law# More 
 to the point with them were peace and prosperity throughout the country , 
 the fact that law was administered with honesty and justice , and that 
 England was safe from her deadly enemies -- the swarthy Spaniards and the 
 scheming French .' (1), '#It# It must be remembered that it was not a question of whether Elizabeth 
 desired marriage .' (1), '#he# Still , Scott felt -- and he was imbued 
 with the spirit and knowledge of that time -- a strong conviction that 
 Elizabeth loved Leicester as she really loved no one else .' (1), '#queen# Simply because she loved him more than any of the rest ; and , 
 knowing this , she knew that if besides her love she granted him any 
 measure of control or power , then she would be but half a queen and 
 would be led either to marry him or else to let him sway her as he 
 would .' (1), '#affairs# Each 
 was queen of a nation whose affairs were entangled with those of a much 
 greater one .' (1), '#They# They are alike remembered in song and story because 
 of qualities that are far more powerful than any physical charm can be .' (1), '#Stuart# Mary Stuart was born six days before her father 's death , and when the

 afterward reigned as Edward VI . , though he died while still a boy .' (1), '#proposal# The

 imperious intriguer whose splendid surroundings were tainted with the 
 corruption which she had brought from her native Italy .' (1), '#manhood# The sickly child would cry 
 all night , for he suffered from abscesses in his ears , and his manhood 
 had been prematurely taken from him .' (1), '#she# For the brief 
 period of a year she was actually the ruler of France ; but then her 
 husband died and she was left a widow , restless , ambitious , and yet no 
 longer having any of the power she loved .' (1), '#liquid# Her 
 skin was fair and pale , so clear and so transparent as to make the story 
 plausible that when she drank from a flask of wine , the red liquid could 
 be seen passing down her slender throat .' (1), '#names# With her slender , 
 graceful hands she was always stroking the face of some favorite -- it 
 might be only the face of a child , or it might be the face of some 
 courtier or poet , or one of the four Marys whose names are linked with 
 hers -- Mary Livingstone , Mary Fleming , Mary Beaton , and Mary Seton , the 
 last of whom remained with her royal mistress until her death .' (1), '#She# She was 
 surrounded everywhere by enemies .' (1), '#she# When she returned to 
 Scotland she was hated because of her religion by the Protestant lords .' (1), '#action# Her every action was set forth in the worst possible light .' (1), '#intellect# She was not a woman to yield herself in love 's last surrender unless her 
 intellect and heart alike had been made captive .' (1), '#she# Even in this she was only 
 following the fashion of the court where she was bred , and she was 
 not unlike her royal relative , Elizabeth of England , who had the same 
 external amorousness coupled with the same internal self - control .' (1), '#Bothwell# Lord Bothwell , like Queen Mary , has been terribly maligned .' (1), '#bridge# The bridge of his nose had been broken ; few observed it , or guessed 
 at the brawl which must have given it to him .' (1), '#Something# Something more , however , must be said of Bothwell .' (1), '#ranter# The surly ranter became softened for a time ,

 had two sovereigns , King Henry and Queen Mary .' (1), '#love# Mary 's self - suggested love for Darnley was extinguished almost on 
 her wedding - night .' (1), '#he# At the end 
 of one mad revel he was found secreted beneath her bed , and was driven 
 out by force .' (1), '#he# Then he was dragged forth , imprisoned , and condemned 
 to death .' (1), '#Rizzio# Darnley held her by the waist while Rizzio 
 was stabbed before her eyes with a cruelty the greater because the queen 
 was soon to become a mother .' (1), '#It# It 
 is recorded of him that never throughout his life could he bear to look 
 upon drawn steel .' (1), '#It# It was revealed to

 so that these two fiery , panting souls could meet .' (1), '#banners# Great banners were raised with execrable daubs 
 representing the murdered Darnley .' (1), '#secession# Even the secession of Norway , a few 
 years ago , was accomplished without bloodshed , and now the two kingdoms

 once domineered and tyrannized over both .' (1), '#ambassadors# The ambassadors of the Swedish kings were received with 
 the utmost deference in every court .' (1), '#child# When the event occurred , the child was seen to be completely covered

 to tell the king , who was waiting in his study for the announcement 
 to be made .' (1), '#he# Though he must 
 have been disappointed at the advent of a daughter , he showed no sign 
 of dissatisfaction or even of surprise ; but , rising , he embraced his 
 sister , saying : 
 " Let us thank God .' (1), '#salute# He 
 ordered that the full royal salute should be fired in every fortress of 
 his kingdom and that displays of fireworks , balls of honor , and court 
 functions should take place ; " for , " as he said , " this is the heir to my 
 throne . "' (1), '#she# He joked about her looks when she was born , when she was mistaken for a

 the people of Holland when the present Queen Wilhelmina was born , to 
 carry on the succession of the House of Orange .' (1), '#commander# The

 the faith to which they adhered .' (1), '#vow# Amid the 
 clashing of swords and the clang of armor this vow was taken , and the 
 king went forth to war .' (1), '#she# Of course , she could not yet be crowned , but a council of able ministers 
 continued the policy of the late king and taught the young queen her 
 first lessons in statecraft .' (1), '#who# And indeed why should she fear , who was beloved by all 
 her subjects ?' (1), '#Germany# Denmark yielded up rich provinces , while Germany was compelled to 
 grant Sweden membership in the German diet .' (1), '#She# She was highly trained in many arts .' (1), '#she# Do not imagine that she is learned only 
 in books , for she is equally so in painting , architecture , sculpture , 
 medals , antiquities , and all curiosities .' (1), '#Sweden# But after she began to make her court a sort of home for art and 
 letters it ceased to be the sort of court Sweden was prepared that for .' (1), '#she# With his associates he taught her a distaste 
 for the simple and healthy life that she had been accustomed to lead .' (1), '#names# It is probable that 
 Bourdelot was her first lover , but there were many others whose names 
 are recorded in the annals of the time .' (1), '#it# She dressed almost without thought , and it is said that 
 she combed her hair not more than twice a month .' (1), '#ambitions# Her political ambitions were checked 
 by the rising discontent of her people , who began to look down upon her 
 and to feel ashamed of her shame .' (1), '#him# Therefore she chose out her cousin 
 Charles , declared that he was to be her successor , and finally caused 
 him to be proclaimed as such before the assembled estates of the realm .' (1), '#She# She was surrounded by men of 
 letters , with whom she amused herself , and she took to herself a lover , 
 the Marquis Monaldeschi .' (1), '#He# He had been supplanted in her 
 favor by another Italian , one Sentanelli , who was the captain of her 
 guard .' (1), '#letters# By 
 this treacherous trick he hoped to end the relations between his rival

 instantly recognized their true source .' (1), '#she# She saw that she was betrayed 
 by her former favorite and that he had taken a revenge which might 
 seriously compromise her .' (1), '#It# It may be summed up briefly here , because it is the testimony 
 of an eye - witness who knew Christina .' (1), '#priest# A little after midnight , when all was still , the priest , 
 Father Le Bel , was aroused and ordered to go at once to the Galerie des 
 Cerfs , or Hall of Stags , in another part of the palace .' (1), '#he# When he asked 
 why , he was told : 
 " It is by the order of her majesty the Swedish queen . "' (1), '#who# Beside the 
 queen , as if awaiting orders , stood three figures , who could with some 
 difficulty be made out as three soldiers of her guard .' (1), '#He# He was confused by 
 the sight of them and by the incisive words in which Christina showed 
 how he had both insulted her and had tried to shift the blame upon 
 Sentanelli .' (1), '#absolution# The 
 absolution was pronounced ; and , following it , one of the guards slashed 
 the marquis across the forehead .' (1), '#throat# But his throat 
 was partly protected by a coat of mail , so that three or four strokes 
 delivered there had slight effect .' (1), '#sword# Finally , however , a long , narrow 
 sword was thrust into his side , after which the marquis made no sound .' (1), '#It# It was said that Sentanelli had slapped 
 the marquis in a fit of jealousy , though some added that it was done

 word was sent to Christina that she must leave Fontainebleau .' (1), '#words# Her words were listened to at every court in 
 Europe .' (1), '#she# She annotated the classics , she made beautiful collections , and 
 she was regarded as a privileged person whose acts no one took amiss .' (1), '#She# She was bred a man , she was almost a son to her great father ; and yet , 
 instead of the sonorous epitaph that is inscribed beside her tomb , 
 perhaps a truer one would be the words of the vexed Pope : 
 " E DONNA ! "' (1), '#Prayers# Prayers are said for her at English

 cheeses , than there was already a Stuart legend .' (1), '#hand# Many hardships they underwent while Cromwell ruled with his iron hand ;

 on every sea .' (1), '#match# The queen regent , being at odds with Spain , and wishing to 
 secure an ally against that power , made overtures to Charles , asking him

 George IV . may have married Mrs. Fitzherbert ; yet there is not the 
 slightest proof of it , and it must be classed with popular legends .' (1), '#It# It must be confessed that in his attachments 
 to English women Charles showed little care for rank or station .' (1), '#navy# The 
 treasury might be nearly bankrupt ; the navy might be routed by the 
 Dutch ; the king himself might be too much given to dissipation ; but his 
 people forgave him all , because everybody knew that Charles would clap 
 an honest citizen on the back and joke with all who came to see him feed 
 the swans in Regent 's Park .' (1), '#it# The popular name for him was " Rowley , " or " Old Rowley "-- a nickname 
 of mysterious origin , though it is said to have been given him from a 
 fancied resemblance to a famous hunter in his stables .' (1), '#emblems# Oughtred , the famous mathematician , died of joy when the royal

 Southampton , Grafton , and Northumberland , were also the sons of Charles .' (1), '#it# One can find no better picture of his court than that which Sir Walter 
 Scott has drawn so vividly in Peveril of the Peak ; or , if one wishes 
 first - hand evidence , it can be found in the diaries of Evelyn and of 
 Samuel Pepys .' (1), '#it# In them we find the rakes and dicers , full of strange 
 oaths , deep drunkards , vile women and still viler men , all striving for 
 the royal favor and offering the filthiest lures , amid routs and balls 
 and noisy entertainments , of which it is recorded that more than once 
 some woman gave birth to a child among the crowd of dancers .' (1), '#herself# No wonder that the little Portuguese queen kept to herself and did not 
 let herself be drawn into this swirling , roaring , roistering saturnalia .' (1), '#exception# This one exception has been so greatly written of , 
 both in fiction and in history , as to make it seem almost unnecessary to 
 add another word ; yet it may well be worth while to separate the fiction 
 from the fact and to see how much of the legend of Eleanor Gwyn is true .' (1), '#children# Within this dreadful place children were kidnapped and trained to 
 various forms of vice .' (1), '#It# It must be said that in everything that was external , except her beauty , 
 she fell short of a fastidious taste .' (1), '#she# All that external 
 circumstances could do to push her down into the mire was done ; yet she 
 was not pushed down , but emerged as one of those rare souls who have in 
 their natures an uncontaminated spring of goodness and honesty .' (1), '#Charles# Charles is said first to have met her when he , incognito , with another 
 friend , was making the rounds of the theaters at night .' (1), '#she# There came a time when she was known to be a mistress 
 of the king , and she bore a son , who was ennobled as the Duke of St. 
 Albans , but who did not live to middle age .' (1), '#who# There came a time when she was known to be a mistress 
 of the king , and she bore a son , who was ennobled as the Duke of St. 
 Albans , but who did not live to middle age .' (1), '#heart# Again , her heart was touched at the misfortunes of the old soldiers who 
 had fought for Charles and for his father during the Civil War , and who 
 were now neglected , while the treasury was emptied for French favorites , 
 and while the policy of England itself was bought and sold in France .' (1), '#who# Again , her heart was touched at the misfortunes of the old soldiers who 
 had fought for Charles and for his father during the Civil War , and who 
 were now neglected , while the treasury was emptied for French favorites ,

 had fought for Charles and for his father during the Civil War , and who 
 were now neglected , while the treasury was emptied for French favorites ,

 Chelsea Hospital was founded .' (1), '#import# Of anecdotes concerning her there are many , but not often has their real 
 import been detected .' (1), '#spirit# In most women this spirit of self - sacrifice is checked and kept within 
 ordinary bounds by the circumstances of their lives .' (1), '#music# The music 
 of their lives is written in a minor key .' (1), '#they# Unless such women are 
 beautiful and young and charming they are treated badly ; and this is 
 often true in spite of all their natural attractiveness , for they seem 
 to court ill usage as if they were saying frankly : 
 " Come , take us !' (1), '#story# Her story is linked with that of a man no less remarkable than herself , 
 a hero of chivalry , a marvel of courage , of fascination , and of 
 irresponsibility .' (1), '#Adrienne# Adrienne was brought up at the wash - tub , and became accustomed to a 
 wandering life , in which she went from one town to another .' (1), '#she# It was not the wash - tub that made her so , 
 for she had been born to it ; nor was it the half - mad outbreaks of her 
 father , because to her , at least , he was not unkind .' (1), '#Ambition# Ambition was 
 awakened in her before she was ten years of age , when she began to 
 learn and to recite poems -- learning them , as has been said , " between the 
 wash - tub and the ironing - board , " and reciting them to the admiration of 
 older and wiser people than she .' (1), '#she# When she was thirteen her father moved to Paris , where she was placed at 
 school -- a very humble school in a very humble quarter of the city .' (1), '#courtyard# The courtyard was crowded by 
 gentlemen and ladies , by people of distinction from the court , and at 
 last even by actors and actresses from the Comedie Franchise .' (1), '#proceedings# Hence legal 
 proceedings were begun , and the most famous actresses in Paris talked 
 of having these clever children imprisoned !' (1), '#warrant# Upon this the company sought 
 the precincts of the Temple , where no legal warrant could be served 
 without the express order of the king himself .' (1), '#theory# This same 
 theory was both held and practised by the late Benoit Constant Coquelin .' (1), '#it# To some extent it was the theory of Garrick and Fechter and Edwin Booth ; 
 though it was rejected by the two Keans , and by Edwin Forrest , who 
 entered so throughly into the character which he assumed , and who let 
 loose such tremendous bursts of passion that other actors dreaded to 
 support him on the stage in such parts as Spartacus and Metamora .' (1), '#plays# For the first time the great classic plays were given , not 
 in the monotonous singsong which had become a sort of theatrical 
 convention , but with all the fire and naturalness of life .' (1), '#salon# Her salon was thronged by men and women of rank .' (1), '#nature# In all her letters one finds a plaintive 
 tone , a little moaning sound that shows how slightly her nature had been 
 changed .' (1), '#it# Already , though so young , his career had been a strange one ; and it was 
 destined to be still more remarkable .' (1), '#marriage# Having no fortune of 
 his own , a marriage was arranged for him with the Countess von Loben , 
 who was immensely wealthy ; but in three years he had squandered all 
 her money upon his pleasures , and had , moreover , got himself heavily in 
 debt .' (1), '#French# Even his broken French was held to be quite charming ; 
 and to see him break a horseshoe with his fingers threw every one into 
 raptures .' (1), '#he# No wonder , then , that he was welcomed in the very highest circles .' (1), '#it# Of her it has been said that she was 
 " the personification of a kiss , the incarnation of an embrace , the ideal 
 of a dream of love . "' (1), '#hair# Her chestnut hair was tinted with little gleams of 
 gold .' (1), '#she# But by 
 the king 's orders she had been forced to marry a hunchback -- a man whose 
 very limbs were so weakened by disease and evil living that they would 
 often fail to support him , and he would fall to the ground , a writhing , 
 screaming mass of ill - looking flesh .' (1), '#she# The charge proved quite untrue , and so she left her husband , 
 having won the sympathy of her own world , which held that she had been 
 insulted .' (1), '#who# But it was not she who was destined to win and hold the love 
 of Maurice de Saxe .' (1), '#he# Not long after his appearance in the French capital he was invited to 
 dine with the " Queen of Paris , " Adrienne Lecouvreur .' (1), '#she# He was merry , and full of quips and jests ; she was reserved and 
 melancholy .' (1), '#heart# She had supposed that all such things were 
 passed and gone , that her heart was closed for ever , that she was 
 invulnerable ; and yet here she found herself clinging about the neck 
 of this impetuous soldier and showing him all the shy fondness and 
 the unselfish devotion of a young girl .' (1), '#Saxe# Maurice de Saxe had been sired by a king .' (1), '#money# He hastened thither and found that money was needed to 
 carry out his plans .' (1), '#She# She is described 
 as indolent and sensual , and she once declared that the chief good in 
 the world was love .' (1), '#who# Adrienne , who was left behind in Paris , knew very little of what was 
 going on .' (1), '#he# One was that if 
 her lover secured the duchy he must be parted from her .' (1), '#ambition# The other was 
 that without money his ambition must be thwarted , and that he would then 
 return to her .' (1), '#plot# It was clear to the great actress that a plot had been devised 
 against her .' (1), '#lackeys# Even the 
 hired lackeys were overawed by it .' (1), '#deeds# Those were evil times , when dark deeds were 
 committed by the great almost with impunity .' (1), '#she# Not long afterward , on the night of March 15 , 1730 , Adrienne Lecouvreur 
 was acting in one of Voltaire 's plays with all her power and instinctive 
 art when suddenly she was seized with the most frightful pains .' (1), '#families# The royal families of Europe are widely known , yet not all of them are 
 equally renowned .' (1), '#they# Thus , the house of Romanoff , although comparatively 
 young , stands out to the mind with a sort of barbaric power , more 
 vividly than the Austrian house of Hapsburg , which is the oldest 
 reigning family in Europe , tracing its beginnings backward until 
 they are lost in the Dark Ages .' (1), '#volume# This is the name 
 of Stuart , about which a whole volume might be written to recall its 
 suggestions and its reminiscences .' (1), '#anything# The first Stuart ( then Stewart ) of whom anything is known got his name 
 from the title of " Steward of Scotland , " which remained in the family 
 for generations , until the sixth of the line , by marriage with Princess 
 Marjory Bruce , acquired the Scottish crown .' (1), '#he# His son , Charles I. , was perhaps one of the worst rulers that England 
 has ever had ; yet his uprightness of life , his melancholy yet handsome 
 face , his graceful bearing , and the strong religious element in his 
 character , together with the fact that he was put to death after being 
 treacherously surrendered to his enemies -- all these have combined to 
 make almost a saint of him .' (1), '#Scott# When George 
 IV . visited Edinburgh , Scott was completely carried away by his loyal 
 enthusiasm .' (1), '#she# No one , however , accused Queen Victoria of being frivolous , 
 and she was not supposed to have a strong sense of humor .' (1), '#None# None the less , 
 after listening to the skirling of the bagpipes and to the romantic 
 ballads which were sung in Scotland she is said to have remarked with a 
 sort of sigh :' (1), '#she# None the less , 
 after listening to the skirling of the bagpipes and to the romantic 
 ballads which were sung in Scotland she is said to have remarked with a 
 sort of sigh :' (1), '#Victoria# Before Queen Victoria was born , when all the sons of George III .' (1), '#Duke# were 
 childless , the Duke of Kent was urged to marry , so that he might have a 
 family to continue the succession .' (1), '#feeling# But it is perhaps to this claimant 's son , the last of the militant 
 Stuarts , that more chivalrous feeling has been given than to any other .' (1), '#side# It was a daring deed , and the spectacular side of it has been often 
 commemorated , especially in Sir Walter Scott 's Waverley .' (1), '#regiments# Most of 
 the British troops were absent in Flanders , and the few regiments that 
 could be mustered to meet him were appalled by the ferocity and reckless 
 courage of the Highlanders , who leaped down like wildcats from their 
 hills and flung themselves with dirk and sword upon the British cannon .' (1), '#troops# The British troops had been defeated on the 
 Continent by Marshal Saxe , of whom I have already written , and by 
 Marshal d'Estrees .' (1), '#It# It 
 is said that on one occasion , in a fit of temper , he actually kicked the 
 prime minister .' (1), '#it# As between him and the brilliant Stuart there would have been 
 no hesitation had the choice been merely one of men ; but it was believed 
 that the return of the Stuarts meant the return of something like 
 absolute government , of taxation without sanction of law , and of 
 religious persecution .' (1), '#English# Sharp 
 opposition in Parliament compelled him time and again to yield ; and when 
 he was in Hanover the English were left to work out the problem of free 
 government .' (1), '#army# Hence , although Prince Charles Edward fascinated all who met him , and 
 although a small army was raised for his support , still the unromantic , 
 common - sense Englishmen felt that things were better than in the days 
 gone by , and most of them refused to take up arms for the cause which 
 sentimentally they favored .' (1), '#they# Although the Stuart troops reached a point as far 
 south as Derby , they were soon pushed backward into Scotland , pursued by 
 an army of about nine thousand men under the Duke of Cumberland , son of 
 George II .' (1), '#he# Cumberland was no soldier ; he had been soundly beaten by the French 
 on the famous field of Fontenoy .' (1), '#he# he was believed to say .' (1), '#order# The officer objected and begged that such an order as that should 
 be given in writing .' (1), '#Men# Men and women were whipped and tortured on 
 slight suspicion or to extract information .' (1), '#apology# As to Cumberland 's order for 
 " No quarter , " if any apology can be made for such brutality , it must be 
 found in the fact that the Highland chiefs had on their side agreed to 
 spare no captured enemy .' (1), '#it# The battle has also left a name commonly given to the nine of diamonds , 
 which is called " the curse of Scotland , " because it is said that on that 
 card Cumberland wrote his bloodthirsty order .' (1), '#It# It had been sent to bring him troops and a large supply 
 of money , but he turned his back upon it and made his way into the 
 Highlands on foot , closely pursued by English soldiers and Lowland 
 spies .' (1), '#prince# After the battle of Culloden the prince would have been captured had not 
 a Scottish girl named Flora Macdonald met him , caused him to be dressed 
 in the clothes of her waiting - maid , and thus got him off to the Isle of 
 Skye .' (1), '#him# After the battle of Culloden the prince would have been captured had not 
 a Scottish girl named Flora Macdonald met him , caused him to be dressed 
 in the clothes of her waiting - maid , and thus got him off to the Isle of 
 Skye .' (1), '#she# As for Flora , she was arrested and imprisoned for five months on English 
 vessels of war .' (1), '#court# At the death of James III . , even this court was disintegrated , and 
 Prince Charles led a roving life under the title of Earl of Albany .' (1), '#She# She was often visited by Vittorio Alfieri , 
 the great Italian poet and dramatist .' (1), '#widow# After the prince 's death his widow is said to have been married to 
 Alfieri , and for the rest of her life she lived in Florence , though 
 Alfieri died nearly twenty - one years before her .' (1), '#It# It has often been said that the greatest Frenchman who ever lived was 
 in reality an Italian .' (1), '#It# It might with equal truth be asserted that the 
 greatest Russian woman who ever lived was in reality a German .' (1), '#Russia# At the middle of the eighteenth century Russia was governed by the 
 Empress Elizabeth , daughter of Peter the Great .' (1), '#capacity# In her own time , and for 
 a long while afterward , her real capacity was obscured by her apparent 
 indolence , her fondness for display , and her seeming vacillation ; but 
 now a very high place is accorded her in the history of Russian rulers .' (1), '#place# In her own time , and for 
 a long while afterward , her real capacity was obscured by her apparent 
 indolence , her fondness for display , and her seeming vacillation ; but 
 now a very high place is accorded her in the history of Russian rulers .' (1), '#woman# In her early years this imperial woman had been betrothed to Louis XV .' (1), '#match# but the match was broken off .' (1), '#youth# Peter , then a mere youth of seventeen , was delighted with so splendid a 
 future , and came at once to St. Petersburg .' (1), '#she# And so in 1744 , when she was but sixteen years of age , she was taken by 
 her mother to St. Petersburg .' (1), '#face# She was fair - haired , with dark - blue eyes ; and 
 her face , though never beautiful , was made piquant and striking by the 
 fact that her brows were very dark in contrast with her golden hair .' (1), '#forebodings# Frederick the Great 's forebodings , which had led him to withhold 
 his sister 's hand , were almost immediately justified in the case of 
 Catharine .' (1), '#whoops# The whoops and howls and vile songs of his creatures could 
 be heard by Catharine ; and sometimes he would stagger into her rooms , 
 accompanied by his drunken minions .' (1), '#she# Chastity was a thing of which the 
 average Russian had no conception ; and therefore it is not strange that 
 Catharine , with her intense and sensitive nature , should have turned to 
 some of these for the love which she had sought in vain from the half 
 imbecile to whom she had been married .' (1), '#Much# Much has been written of this side of her earlier and later life ; yet , 
 though it is impossible to deny that she had favorites , one should judge 
 very gently the conduct of a girl so young and thrust into a life whence 
 all the virtues seemed to be excluded .' (1), '#one# The one with whom her name has 
 been most often coupled was Gregory Orloff .' (1), '#it# Their power fascinated Catharine , and it was currently 
 declared that Gregory Orloff was her lover .' (1), '#husband# When she was in her thirty - second year her husband was proclaimed Czar , 
 after the death of the Empress Elizabeth .' (1), '#they# Historians have 
 given him much credit for two great reforms that are connected with his 
 name ; and yet the manner in which they were actually brought about is 
 rather ludicrous .' (1), '#sounds# Standing before Peter , his voice rang out with the tone of a battle 
 trumpet , so that the sounds of revelry were hushed .' (1), '#rights# With these words Gudovitch thrust into Peter 's trembling hand two 
 proclamations , one abolishing the secret bureau of police , which had 
 become an instrument of tyrannous oppression , and the other restoring to 
 the nobility many rights of which they had been deprived .' (1), '#they# With these words Gudovitch thrust into Peter 's trembling hand two 
 proclamations , one abolishing the secret bureau of police , which had

 the nobility many rights of which they had been deprived .' (1), '#period# As before , his brief period of good sense was succeeded by another of 
 the wildest folly .' (1), '#bodyguard# His bodyguard was made up of German troops -- thus exciting 
 the jealousy of the Russian soldiers .' (1), '#who# He thrust his mistresses upon her ; and 
 at last he ordered her , with her own hand , to decorate the Countess 
 Vorontzoff , who was known to be his maitresse en titre .' (1), '#she# But while the matter was still under discussion she was awakened early 
 one morning by Alexis Orloff .' (1), '#We# " We have been betrayed ! "' (1), '#she# Immediately 
 afterward the priests anointed her as regent in the name of her son ; but 
 as she left the church she was saluted by the people , as well as by the 
 soldiers , as empress in her own right .' (1), '#He# He was taken to 
 Ropsha and confined within a single room .' (1), '#Catharine# Catharine was shocked by the intelligence , but she had no choice save 
 to accept the result of excessive zeal .' (1), '#body# When 
 his body was laid out for burial the extravasated blood is said to have 
 oozed out even through his hands , staining the gloves that had been 
 placed upon them .' (1), '#blood# When 
 his body was laid out for burial the extravasated blood is said to have 
 oozed out even through his hands , staining the gloves that had been 
 placed upon them .' (1), '#names# And yet , though she had lovers whose names have been 
 carefully recorded , even she fulfilled the law of womanhood -- which is to 
 love deeply and intensely only once .' (1), '#Taurida# Thus , after Taurida and the Crimea had been added to the empire 
 by Potemkin 's agency , Catharine set out with him to view her new 
 possessions .' (1), '#he# He might be absent , heading armies 
 or ruling provinces , and on his return he would be greeted with even 
 greater fondness than before .' (1), '#carriage# His carriage was stopped , a 
 rug was spread beneath a tree by the roadside , and there he died , in the 
 country which he had added to the realms of Russia .' (1), '#rug# His carriage was stopped , a 
 rug was spread beneath a tree by the roadside , and there he died , in the 
 country which he had added to the realms of Russia .' (1), '#head# We see her despised , 
 insulted , and made the butt of brutal men and still more fiendish women ; 
 until at last the hideous tumbrel conveys her to the guillotine , where 
 her head is severed from her body and her corpse is cast down into a 
 bloody pool .' (1), '#emotions# In these two pictures our emotions are played upon in turn -- admiration , 
 reverence , devotion , and then pity , indignation , and the shudderings of 
 horror .' (1), '#She# She was born in Vienna , in 1755 , the daughter of the Emperor Francis 
 and of that warrior - queen , Maria Theresa .' (1), '#she# At fourteen , when she was betrothed to the heir to the French throne , 
 she was a dumpy , mean - looking little creature , with no distinction 
 whatever , and with only her bright golden hair to make amends for her 
 many blemishes .' (1), '#they# The courtiers about him might be vile 
 beneath the surface , yet they were compelled to deport themselves with 
 the form and the etiquette that had become traditional in France .' (1), '#he# Crowds came 
 every morning to view the king in his bed before he arose ; the same 
 crowds watched him as he was dressed by the gentlemen of the bedchamber , 
 and as he breakfasted and went through all the functions which are 
 usually private .' (1), '#escapades# Her escapades at first would have been thought mild 
 enough had she not been a " daughter of France " ; but they served to shock 
 the old French king , and likewise , perhaps even more , her own imperial 
 mother , Maria Theresa .' (1), '#report# When a report of the young girl 's conduct was brought to her the empress 
 was at first mute with indignation .' (1), '#ambassador# The Austrian ambassador to France was instructed to warn the Dauphiness 
 to be more discreet .' (1), '#It# It was hinted in many quarters , and it has been many times repeated , 
 that Louis was lacking in virility .' (1), '#It# It had been made 
 against some of his predecessors .' (1), '#It# It was afterward hurled at Napoleon 
 the Great , and also Napoleon the Little .' (1), '#XV# Louis XV . , who 
 had become hopelessly and helplessly infatuated with the low - born Jeanne 
 du Barry , was stricken down with smallpox of the most virulent type .' (1), '#who# His death - room was fetid 
 with disease , and even the long corridors of the palace reeked with 
 infection , while the motley mob of men and women , clad in silks and 
 satins and glittering with jewels , hurried from the spot to pay their 
 homage to the new Louis , who was spoken of as " the Desired . "' (1), '#body# The body of 
 the late monarch was hastily thrown into a mass of quick - lime , and was 
 driven away in a humble wagon , without guards and with no salute , 
 save from a single veteran , who remembered the glories of Fontenoy and 
 discharged his musket as the royal corpse was carried through the palace 
 gates .' (1), '#corpse# The body of

 gates .' (1), '#sluggishness# On the other side is her husband , whose 
 sluggishness may be judged by quoting from a diary which he kept during 
 the month in which he was married .' (1), '#What# What might have been expected from a young girl placed as this queen was 
 placed ?' (1), '#queen# What might have been expected from a young girl placed as this queen was 
 placed ?' (1), '#edges# Again , she would 
 persist in wearing her frilled and lace - trimmed petticoats long after 
 their dainty edges had been smirched and blackened .' (1), '#things# Yet these things might have been counteracted had she gone no further .' (1), '#she# When she fell ill with the measles she was attended in her 
 sick - chamber by four gentlemen of the court .' (1), '#king# The king was forbidden to 
 enter lest he might catch the childish disorder .' (1), '#who# From this time Fersen was among those who were most intimately favored 
 by the queen .' (1), '#head# He had the privilege of attending her private receptions 
 at the palace of the Trianon , and was a conspicuous figure at the feasts 
 given in the queen 's honor by the Princess de Lamballe , a beautiful girl 
 whose head was destined afterward to be severed from her body and borne 
 upon a bloody pike through the streets of Paris .' (1), '#truth# Then 
 came a time when the truth was made clear to both of them .' (1), '#she# Fersen was 
 near her while she was singing to the harpsichord , and " she was betrayed 
 by her own music into an avowal which song made easy . "' (1), '#womanhood# She only felt that her womanhood had been 
 starved and slighted , and that here was a noble - minded lover of whom she 
 could be proud .' (1), '#announcement# Some time after this announcement was officially made of the approaching 
 accouchement of the queen .' (1), '#almoner# The 
 grand almoner , who presided , asked ; 
 " What name shall be given to this child ? "' (1), '#name# The 
 grand almoner , who presided , asked ; 
 " What name shall be given to this child ? "' (1), '#despatch# In fact , the following secret despatch was sent to the King of Sweden by 
 his envoy :' (1), '#she# The queen wept because Fersen had resolved to leave her lest she should 
 be exposed to further gossip .' (1), '#it# He even allowed it to be supposed 
 that he was planning a marriage with a rich young Swedish woman who 
 had been naturalized in England .' (1), '#who# He even allowed it to be supposed 
 that he was planning a marriage with a rich young Swedish woman who 
 had been naturalized in England .' (1), '#epithets# Violent epithets were hurled at the king .' (1), '#phrases# As for 
 the queen , the most filthy phrases were showered upon her by the men , 
 and even more so by the women , who swarmed out of the slums and sought 
 her life .' (1), '#it# At last , in 1791 , it was decided that the king and the queen and their 
 children , of whom they now had three , should endeavor to escape from 
 Paris .' (1), '#they# Every 
 one remembers how they were discovered and halted at Varennes .' (1), '#party# The royal 
 party was escorted back to Paris by the mob , which chanted with insolent 
 additions : 
 " We 've brought back the baker , the baker 's wife , and the baker 's boy !' (1), '#efforts# His efforts have been described 
 by Grandat ; but they were of no avail .' (1), '#king# The king was executed in January , 1792 .' (1), '#name# There will come a time when the name of Aaron Burr will be cleared from 
 the prejudice which now surrounds it , when he will stand in the public 
 estimation side by side with Alexander Hamilton , whom he shot in a duel 
 in 1804 , but whom in many respects he curiously resembled .' (1), '#Burr# Burr and Hamilton were born within a year of each other -- Burr being 
 a grandson of Jonathan Edwards , and Alexander Hamilton being the 
 illegitimate son of a Scottish merchant in the West Indies .' (1), '#Burr# On one occasion Burr was quite unjustly suspected by Washington of 
 looking over the latter 's shoulder while he was writing . "' (1), '#cause# This , however , was the end of their altercation The cause of Hamilton 's 
 difference with his chief is not known , but it was a much more serious 
 quarrel ; so that the young officer left his staff position in a fury and 
 took no part in the war until the end , when he was present at the battle 
 of Yorktown .' (1), '#war# Burr , on the other hand , continued his 
 military service until the war was ended , routing the enemy at 
 Hackensack , enduring the horrors of Valley Forge , commanding a brigade 
 at the battle of Monmouth , and heading the defense of the city of New 
 Haven .' (1), '#it# Neither of them 
 was averse to love affairs , though it may be said that Hamilton sought 
 women , while Burr was rather sought by women .' (1), '#Burr# Neither of them

 women , while Burr was rather sought by women .' (1), '#Hamilton# When Secretary of the 
 Treasury , Hamilton was obliged to confess an adulterous amour in order 
 to save himself from the charge of corrupt practices in public office .' (1), '#Hamilton# Hamilton was obliged to confess his illicit acts while his wife , 
 formerly Miss Elizabeth Schuyler , was living .' (1), '#he# When he was arrested 
 in the Western forests , charged with high treason , the sound of his 
 voice won from jury after jury verdicts of acquittal .' (1), '#name# Perhaps one 
 ought not to call it the first romance , for at eighteen , while he was 
 studying law at Litchfield , a girl , whose name has been suppressed , made 
 an open avowal of love for him .' (1), '#name# Two years later , after Burr had seen hard service at Quebec and on 
 Manhattan Island , his name was associated with that of a very beautiful 
 girl named Margaret Moncrieffe .' (1), '#she# She was the daughter of a British major , 
 but in some way she had been captured while within the American lines .' (1), '#captivity# Her captivity was regarded as little more than a joke ; but while she was 
 thus a prisoner she saw a great deal of Burr .' (1), '#intimacy# It is doubtful how far their intimacy was carried .' (1), '#horse# The barge was 
 well supplied with buffalo - skins , upon which the horse was thrown with 
 his legs bound , and then half an hour 's rowing brought them to the 
 other side .' (1), '#life# No more ideal 
 family life could be conceived than his , and the letters which passed 
 between the two are full of adoration .' (1), '#it# When it is remembered that these letters were written after nine years 
 of marriage it is hard to believe all the evil things that have been 
 said of Burr .' (1), '#letters# When it is remembered that these letters were written after nine years

 daughter Theodosia , whose beauty and accomplishments were known 
 throughout the country .' (1), '#she# Burr took the greatest pains in her education ,

 industrious , and patient .' (1), '#who# He himself , who has been described as a 
 voluptuary , delighted in the endurance of cold and heat and of severe 
 labor .' (1), '#attention# my dear Theo , that you will be very soon beyond all 
 verbal criticism , and that my whole attention will be presently directed 
 to the improvement of your style .' (1), '#character# Theodosia Burr married into a family of good old English stock , where 
 riches were abundant , and high character was regarded as the best of

 Theodosia 's health was shattered by her sorrow .' (1), '#health# In 1812 , when her husband had been elected 
 Governor of his state , her only child -- a sturdy boy of eleven -- died , and 
 Theodosia 's health was shattered by her sorrow .' (1), '#he# When Burr arrived he was met by a letter which told him that his 
 grandson was dead and that Theodosia was coming to him .' (1), '#news# Weeks sped by , and no news was heard of the ill - fated Patriot .' (1), '#hope# At 
 last all hope was given up .' (1), '#crew# In time the crew of a pirate vessel was captured and sentenced to be 
 hanged .' (1), '#It# It has always been supposed that this intrepid girl may have been 
 Theodosia Allston .' (1), '#it# This resolute courage , this stern joy in danger , this perfect 
 equanimity , made Burr especially attractive to women , who love courage , 
 the more so when it is coupled with gentleness and generosity .' (1), '#man# Perhaps no man in our country has been so vehemently accused regarding 
 his relations with the other sex .' (1), '#stories# The most improbable stories were told 
 about him , even by his friends .' (1), '#charge# The charge of immorality

 promiscuously at all the great men of history , including , in our own 
 country , Washington and Jefferson as well as Burr .' (1), '#it# The charge of immorality

 promiscuously at all the great men of history , including , in our own 
 country , Washington and Jefferson as well as Burr .' (1), '#nothing# At the time , 
 however , nothing was thought of it ; but presently Burr brought to the 
 house the serious and somewhat pedantic James Madison and introduced him 
 to the hoyden .' (1), '#mind# A woman very 
 rarely asks an opinion or seeks advice on such an occasion till her 
 mind is wholly made up , and then it is with the hope and expectation 
 of obtaining a sanction , and not that she means to be governed by your 
 disapproval .' (1), '#he# There is no earthly reason for believing this , except that 
 Burr sometimes stopped overnight at the tavern in Kinderhook which was 
 kept by Van Buren 's putative father , and that Van Buren in later life 
 showed an astuteness equal to that of Aaron Burr himself , so that he was 
 called by his opponents " the fox of Kinderhook . "' (1), '#Buren# But , as Van Buren was 
 born in December of the same year ( 1782 ) in which Burr was married to 
 Theodosia Prevost , the story the ardent affection which Burr showed his wife , not only 
 before their marriage , but afterward until her death is utterly improbable when we remember , 
 as we must , .' (1), '#he# Putting aside these purely spurious instances , as well as others cited 
 by Mr. Parton , the fact remains that Aaron Burr , like Daniel Webster , 
 found a great attraction in the society of women ; that he could please 
 them and fascinate them to an extraordinary degree ; and that during 
 his later life he must be held quite culpable in this respect .' (1), '#stories# Many other stories are told of him .' (1), '#it# For instance , it is said that he 
 once took a stage - coach from Jersey City to Philadelphia .' (1), '#she# Nevertheless , so the story goes , before they had reached 
 Newark she was absolutely swayed by his charm of manner ; and when the 
 coach made its last stop before Philadelphia' (1), '#It# It must also be said that , unlike those of Webster and Hamilton , his 
 intrigues were never carried on with women of the lower sort .' (1), '#intrigues# It must also be said that , unlike those of Webster and Hamilton , his

 arrayed herself in one of her most magnificent Paris gowns ; the members 
 of her household and eight servants were called in and the ceremony

 woman -- a mere girl -- who was so infatuated with Burr that when she was 
 told of his marriage it nearly broke her heart .' (1), '#he# Finally , in the early 
 part of that same year he had been accused of being the father of a 
 new - born child , and in spite of his age every one believed the charge to 
 be true .' (1), '#she# When he died , only about a year later , she is said to have burst into 
 a flood of tears -- another tribute to the fascination which Aaron Burr 
 exercised through all his checkered life .' (1), '#it# On the other hand , in his political career there was a touch of 
 insincerity , and it can scarcely be denied that he used his charm too 
 often to the injury of those women who could not resist his insinuating 
 ways and the caressing notes of his rich voice .' (1), '#wretch# One of his biographers very truly says that no such wretch as Burr has 
 been declared to be could have won and held the love of such a wife and 
 such a daughter as Burr had .' (1), '#Burr# One of his biographers very truly says that no such wretch as Burr has 
 been declared to be could have won and held the love of such a wife and 
 such a daughter as Burr had .' (1), '#witnesses# When all the other witnesses have been heard , let the two Theodosias

 affectionate veneration unsurpassed by any recorded in history or

 humbled by the emperor who came from Corsica .' (1), '#who# , who was made Prince of 
 Wales three days after his birth , and who became prince regent during 
 the insanity of the king .' (1), '#He# He was much given to gallantry -- not so much , as it seemed , for 
 wantonness , but from sheer love of mirth and chivalry .' (1), '#state# He invented buckles , striped 
 waistcoats , and flamboyant collars , but he knew nothing of the 
 principles of kingship or the laws by which a state is governed .' (1), '#episodes# It was not long , however , before 
 these episodes were trampled down into the mire of vulgar scandal .' (1), '#It# It may be assumed that the prince had to borrow 
 it and that this obligation formed part of the debts which Parliament 
 paid for him .' (1), '#It# It may be remarked here that this withholding of permission was strictly 
 enforced .' (1), '#IV# Thus William IV . , who succeeded George IV . , was married , 
 before his accession to the throne , to Mrs. Jordan ( Dorothy Bland ) .' (1), '#who# Afterward he lawfully married a woman of royal birth who was known as 
 Queen Adelaide .' (1), '#father# There is an interesting story which tells how Queen Victoria came to 
 be born because her father , the Duke of Kent , was practically forced 
 to give up a morganatic union which he greatly preferred to a marriage 
 arranged for him by Parliament .' (1), '#Duke# The Duke of Cumberland was for various reasons ineligible ; the Duke of 
 Clarence , later King William IV . , was almost too old ; and therefore , to 
 insure the succession , the Duke of Kent was begged to marry a young and 
 attractive woman , a princess of the house of Saxe - Coburg , who was ready 
 for the honor .' (1), '#he# In the end , however , he was wearied out and was persuaded to marry , but 
 he insisted that a generous sum should be settled on the lady who had 
 been so long his true companion , and to whom , no doubt , he gave many a 
 wistful thought in his new but unfamiliar quarters in Kensington Palace , 
 which was assigned as his residence .' (1), '#sum# In the end , however , he was wearied out and was persuaded to marry , but

 occasion the prince had his friends in Parliament deny the marriage in 
 order that his debts might be paid and new allowances issued to him by 
 the Treasury .' (1), '#gentry# At first the gentry were crowded into lodging - houses and the 
 accommodations were primitive to a degree .' (1), '#places# But soon handsome villas 
 arose on every side ; hotels appeared ; places of amusement were opened .' (1), '#who# This was partly 
 due to the fact that Mrs. Fitzherbert was a Catholic and that she had 
 received a number of French nuns who had been driven out of France at 
 the time of the Revolution .' (1), '#displeasure# But no less displeasure was caused by the 
 prince 's racing and dicing , which swelled his debts to almost a million 
 pounds , so that Parliament and , indeed , the sober part of England were 
 set against him .' (1), '#buildings# In King William 's case it was explained that the dampness of the 
 Pavilion did not suit him ; and as to Queen Victoria , it was said that 
 she disliked the fact that buildings had been erected so as to cut 
 off the view of the sea .' (1), '#wife# At length the time came when the king , Parliament , and the people at 
 large insisted that the Prince of Wales should make a legal marriage , 
 and a wife was selected for him in the person of Caroline , daughter of 
 the Duke of Brunswick .' (1), '#It# It is said that as he 
 took her hand he kissed her , and then , suddenly recoiling , he whispered 
 to one of his friends : 
 " For God 's sake , George , give me a glass of brandy ! "' (1), '#body# Presently , in August , 1821 , only 
 a month after the coronation , she died , and her body was taken back to 
 Brunswick for burial .' (1), '#it# During his last 
 illness she had sent him an affectionate missive which it is said George 
 " read eagerly . "' (1), '#It# It was finally decided that it would be best to burn both his and hers .' (1), '#work# This work was carried out in Mrs. Fitzherbert 's own house by the lady , 
 the duke , and the Earl of Albemarle .' (1), '#it# Of George it may be said that he has left as memories behind him only 
 three things that will be remembered .' (1), '#record# The 
 tragic record of this French girl and her self - sacrifice has been told a 
 thousand times by writers in many languages ; yet almost all of them have 
 neglected the brief romance which followed her daring deed and which was 
 consummated after her death upon the guillotine .' (1), '#she# She did not , however , spend her girlish years amid the fields and woods 
 tending her sheep , as did the other Jeanne d'Arc ; but she was placed 
 in charge of the sisters in a convent , and from them she received such 
 education as she had .' (1), '#she# After she had left the convent she was sent to live with an aunt .' (1), '#it# On the other hand , in Paris , the 
 party of the Mountain , as it was called , ruled with a savage violence 
 that soon was to culminate in the Reign of Terror .' (1), '#he# In his earlier years Marat had been a very different figure -- an 
 accomplished physician , the friend of nobles , a man of science and 
 original thought , so that he was nearly elected to the Academy of 
 Sciences .' (1), '#he# On his return he was hunted by his enemies , so that his only place 
 of refuge was in the sewers and drains of Paris .' (1), '#queen# In January , 1793 , King Louis XVI . met his death upon the scaffold ; and 
 the queen was thrust into a foul prison .' (1), '#pain# His disease 
 had reached a point where the pain could be assuaged only by hot water ;

 in a large tub .' (1), '#she# Through an open door Marat heard her 
 mellow voice and gave orders that she should be admitted .' (1), '#men# To this Marat answered , in his harsh voice : 
 " All these men you mention shall be guillotined in the next few days ! "' (1), '#cry# His cry was meant for one of the two women in the house .' (1), '#Troops# Troops were summoned , she was taken to the Prison de l'Abbaye ,

 the leaders of the rabble .' (1), '#Lux# Adam Lux was arrested for treason against 
 the Republic ; but even these men had no desire to make a martyr of this 
 hot - headed youth .' (1), '#he# Therefore he was tried and speedily found guilty , but an offer was 
 made him that he might have passports that would allow him to return to 
 Germany if only he would sign a retraction of his printed words .' (1), '#courtship# Spirit courtship had been carried on silently all through that 
 terrible cross - examination of Charlotte Corday .' (1), '#heart# His heart was betrothed 
 to hers in that single gleam of the setting sun when she bowed beneath 
 the knife .' (1), '#souls# One may believe that these two souls were finally united

 sprinkled the altar that was still stained with hers .' (1), '#who# There are four women who may be said to have deeply influenced the life 
 of Napoleon .' (1), '#it# so it might as

 through Barras , with whom she was said to be rather intimate .' (1), '#soldier# The young 
 soldier was fascinated by her -- the more because she was older than he 
 and possessed all the practised arts of the creole and the woman of the 
 world .' (1), '#brother# It was amusing to throw him 
 into one of his violent rages ; but Pauline was true at heart , and when 
 her great brother was sent to Elba she followed him devotedly and gave 
 him all her store of jewels , including the famous Borghese diamonds , 
 perhaps the most superb of all gems known to the western world .' (1), '#she# She 
 would gladly have followed him , also , to St. Helena had she been 
 permitted .' (1), '#woman# The fourth woman , of whom I am writing 
 here , may be said to have almost equaled Josephine in her influence on 
 the emperor as well as in the pathos of her life - story .' (1), '#disaster# True , he had had to abandon his long - cherished design of invading and 
 overrunning England , and Nelson had shattered his fleets and practically 
 driven his flag from the sea ; but the naval disaster of Trafalgar had

 most brilliant of all Napoleon 's victories , which left Austria and 
 Russia humbled to the very ground before him .' (1), '#It# It was felt that no sacrifice was

 at last she was compelled to yield .' (1), '#she# As she entered the ballroom she was welcomed by hundreds whom she had 
 never seen before , but who were of the highest nobility of Poland .' (1), '#She# She was overwhelmed by 
 arguments and entreaties .' (1), '#She# She was even accused of being disloyal to the 
 cause of Poland if she refused her consent .' (1), '#we# May we be enabled to say the same of you , to your 
 glory and our own happiness !' (1), '#force# Every force

 man was not merely affectionate and indulgent , but he even showed a 
 certain weakness where his relatives were concerned , so that he let them 
 prey upon him almost without end .' (1), '#he# His passionate love for Josephine before he learned of her 
 infidelity is almost painful to read of ; and even afterward , when he had 
 been disillusioned , and when she was paying Fouche a thousand francs

 friendliness and allowed her extravagance to embarrass him .' (1), '#he# He was planning high

 the map of Europe , to be divided between himself and the Russian Czar , 
 who was still his ally .' (1), '#it# From that moment events moved swiftly ; and before 
 long it was understood that there was to be a new empress in France , and

 Napoleon 's most persistent foe upon the Continent .' (1), '#Louise# Marie Louise had been brought up , as all German girls of rank were then 
 brought up , in quiet simplicity and utter innocence .' (1), '#complexion# Her 
 complexion was rosy , with that peculiar tinge which means that in the 
 course of time it will become red and mottled .' (1), '#what# But take her all in all , she was a simple , childlike , German madchen

 discreet and watchful governess , and what had been told her of Napoleon 
 by her uncles , the archdukes whom he had beaten down in battle .' (1), '#it# May I flatter myself that it 
 will not be decided solely by the duty of parental obedience ?' (1), '#everything# Immediately everything was done to dazzle the imagination of the girl .'

 representatives of the Napoleonic court .' (1), '#governess# Even her governess , who had been with her since her childhood , was not

 to mind what happened in the next five years .' (1), '#horror# The horror of that night 
 could not be obliterated by splendid ceremonies , by studious attention , 
 or by all the pomp and gaiety of the court .' (1), '#Metternich# Metternich was closeted with the empress for a long while .' (1), '#precautions# Constant has recorded that the greatest precautions were 
 taken to prevent any person whatsoever , and especially any man , from 
 approaching the empress save in the presence of witnesses .' (1), '#uniforms# His 
 shabby uniforms were all discarded , and he spent hours in trying on new 
 costumes .' (1), '#vanity# Her vanity was flattered in many ways , and most of all by her 
 appointment as regent of the empire during Napoleon 's absence in the 
 disastrous Russian campaign which began in 1812 .' (1), '#he# His command served in Belgium ; and there , in a 
 skirmish , he was overpowered by the French in superior numbers , but 
 resisted desperately .' (1), '#he# In the melee a saber slashed him across the right 
 side of his face , and he was made prisoner .' (1), '#he# The wound deprived him of 
 his right eye , so that for the rest of his life he was compelled to wear 
 a black bandage to conceal the mutilation .' (1), '#Neipperg# In every way he 
 tried to cross the path of that great soldier , and , though Neipperg was 
 comparatively an unknown man , his indomitable purpose and his continued 
 intrigues at last attracted the notice of the emperor ; for in 1808 
 Napoleon wrote this significant sentence : 
 The Count von Neipperg is openly known to have been the enemy of the 
 French .' (1), '#count# Little did the great conqueror dream how deadly was the blow this 
 Austrian count was destined finally which to deal him !' (1), '#children# She 
 had borne him five children ; and in 1813 he had married her in order 
 that these children might be made legitimate .' (1), '#he# Apart from his exploits on the field of 
 battle he had been attached to the Austrian embassy in Paris , and , 
 strangely enough , had been decorated by Napoleon himself with , the 
 golden eagle of the Legion of Honor .' (1), '#Napoleon# In fact , when Napoleon was sent 
 to Elba , Marie Louise returned to Vienna .' (1), '#man# She was 
 made Duchess of Parma in Italy , and set out for her new possessions ; and 
 the man with the black band across his sightless eye was chosen to be 
 her escort and companion .' (1), '#message# He sent countless messages and many couriers ; but 
 every message was intercepted , and no courier reached his destination .' (1), '#soul# He seemed romantic with a touch of mystery , a gallant 
 soldier whose soul was also touched by sentiment .' (1), '#heart# Napoleon had unrolled before her the drama of 
 sensuality , but her heart had not been given to him .' (1), '#she# In the dim twilight she listened to 
 his words of love ; and then , drawn by that irresistible power which 
 masters pride and woman 's will , she sank into her lover 's arms , yielding 
 to his caresses , and knowing that she would be parted from him no more 
 except by death .' (1), '#he# From that moment he was bound to her by the closest ties and lived with 
 her at the petty court of Parma .' (1), '#children# Three children 
 were born to them before his death in 1829 .' (1), '#friend# When his faithful friend and 
 constant companion at St. Helena , the Count Las Casas , was ordered by 
 Sir Hudson Lowe to depart from St. Helena , Napoleon wrote to him : 
 " Should you see , some day , my wife and son , embrace them .' (1), '#truth# At last the truth was told him , and he received it with that high 
 magnanimity , or it may be fatalism , which at times he was capable of 
 showing .' (1), '#love# There is the taint 
 of grossness about it ; and yet , after all , there is a lesson in it -- the 
 lesson that true love can not be forced or summoned at command , that it

 evoked by sympathy , by tenderness , and by devotion .' (1), '#it# There is the taint

 on any man 's house - door , or on his trunk at a coaching - station , the 
 conspicuous letters " G. T. T. "' (1), '#alligator# Rivers that overran 
 their banks , fever - stricken lowlands where gaunt faces peered out from 
 moldering cabins , bottomless swamps the mud oozed greasily and 
 where where the alligator could be seen slowly moving his repulsive form -- all 
 this stretched on for hundreds of miles to horrify and sicken the 
 emigrants who came toiling on foot or struggling upon emaciated horses .' (1), '#they# Still others descended from the mountains of Tennessee 
 and passed through a more open country and with a greater certainty of 
 self - protection , because they were trained from childhood to wield the 
 rifle and the long sheath - knife .' (1), '#he# Because he was born in Lexington , Virginia , and moved thence with his 
 family to Tennessee , young Sam Houston -- a truly eponymous American 
 hero -- was numbered with " the quality " when , after long wandering , he 
 reached his boyhood home .' (1), '#He# He was never known as anything but " Sam . "' (1), '#It# It is told that nearly forty years after , when Houston had long led a 
 different life and had made his home in Washington , a deputation of more 
 than forty untamed Indians from Texas arrived there under the charge of 
 several army officers .' (1), '#supremacy# We needed no 
 interpreter to tell us that this impressive supremacy was gained in the 
 forest .' (1), '#Houston# In 1828 Governor Houston was obliged to visit different portions of 
 the state , stopping , as was the custom , to visit at the homes of " the 
 quality , " and to be introduced to wives and daughters as well as to 
 their sportsman sons .' (1), '#They# They were surrounded with 
 friends of all classes and ranks , for Houston was the associate of 
 Jackson and was immensely popular in his own state .' (1), '#career# Your political career is ended .' (1), '#Little# Little was heard for another month or two , and then came the 
 announcement that the Governor 's wife had left him and had returned to 
 her parents ' home .' (1), '#state# The 
 state was divided into factions ; and what really concerned a very few 
 was , as usual , made everybody 's business .' (1), '#he# There were times when , if Houston had appeared near the dwelling of his 
 former wife , he would have been lynched or riddled with bullets .' (1), '#satisfaction# However his friends might rage , and however her people might wonder and 
 seek to pry into the secret , no satisfaction was given on either side .' (1), '#man# As a matter of fact , although she did divorce Houston , it 
 was only after several years , and the man whom she subsequently married 
 was not acquainted with her at the time of the separation .' (1), '#what# On both sides of the Atlantic there was a reign 
 of sentiment and a prevalence of what was then called " delicacy .' (1), '#who# Having lived the solitary life of 
 the woods , it was a strange thing for him to meet a girl who had been 
 bred in an entirely different way , who had learned a thousand little 
 reservations and dainty graces , and whose very breath was coyness and 
 reserve .' (1), '#He# He was clad in buckskin and armed with knife 
 and rifle , and served under the old chief Oolooteka .' (1), '#something# This was Texas , of whose condition in those early 
 days something has already been said .' (1), '#They# They were dressed in buckskin and ragged 
 clothing ; but their knives were very bright and their rifles carried 
 surely .' (1), '#dozen# Furthermore , they laughed at odds , and if only a dozen of them 
 were gathered together they would " take on " almost any number of Mexican 
 regulars .' (1), '#attack# A sharp attack was made with these overwhelming odds .' (1), '#who# The contest continued for several days , 
 and finally the Mexicans breached the wall and fell upon the garrison , 
 who were now reduced by more than half .' (1), '#He# He was made commander - in - chief of the scanty 
 Texan forces .' (1), '#Mexicans# The Mexicans were scattered as by a mighty wind , their commander 
 was taken prisoner , and Mexico was forced to give its recognition to 
 Texas as a free republic , of which General Houston became the first 
 president .' (1), '#commander# The Mexicans were scattered as by a mighty wind , their commander

 truth of what has already been given as the probable cause of his first 
 mysterious failure to make a woman happy .' (1), '#Houston# After Texas entered the Union , in 1845 , Houston was elected to the 
 United States Senate , in which he served for thirteen years .' (1), '#he# In 1852 , 
 1856 , and 1860 , as a Southerner who opposed any movement looking toward 
 secession , he was regarded as a possible presidential candidate ; but his 
 career was now almost over , and in 1863 , while the Civil War -- which he 
 had striven to prevent -- was at its height , he died .' (1), '#She# She was born in Limerick in 1818 , but her father 's parents cast off 
 their son and his young wife , the Spanish dancer .' (1), '#She# She was sent back to Europe , however , and had a sort of education in

 viceroy , Lord Normanby , was greatly taken with her .' (1), '#she# On her return to London in 1842 , one Captain 
 Lennox was a fellow passenger ; and their association resulted in an 
 action for divorce , by which she was freed from her husband , and yet by 
 a technicality was not able to marry Lennox , whose family in any case 
 would probably have prevented the wedding .' (1), '#Lola# Mrs. Mayne says , in writing on this point : 
 Even Lola never quite succeeded in being allowed to commit bigamy 
 unmolested , though in later years she did commit it and took refuge in 
 Spain to escape punishment .' (1), '#Theater# Here is the narrative : 
 Her Majesty 's Theater was crowded on the night of June 10,1843 .' (1), '#Things# Things had been done with Lumley 's consummate art ; the 
 packed house was murmurous with excitement .' (1), '#glasses# Ranelagh 's glasses were steadily leveled on the stage from the 
 moment her entrance was imminent .' (1), '#He# He was killed in a duel and left Lola twenty thousand 
 francs and some securities , so that she no longer had to sing in the 
 streets as she did in Warsaw .' (1), '#country# That country 
 was then governed by Ludwig I. , a king as eccentric as Lola herself .' (1), '#he# Therefore when Lola made her first appearance at 
 the Court Theater he was enchanted with her .' (1), '#house# A handsome house was built for her , and a pension 
 of twenty thousand florins was granted her .' (1), '#pension# A handsome house was built for her , and a pension 
 of twenty thousand florins was granted her .' (1), '#they# They did not mind the eccentricities 
 of the king , since these amused them and did the country no perceptible 
 harm ; but they were enraged by this beautiful woman , who had no softness 
 such as a woman ought to have .' (1), '#Daggers# Daggers were drawn ; Lola was hustled and insulted .' (1), '#Lola# Daggers were drawn ; Lola was hustled and insulted .' (1), '#she# The foolish king 
 rushed out to protect her ; and on his arm she was led in safety to the 
 palace .' (1), '#one# No one was hurt , but a great rage took possession of the people .' (1), '#Ludwig# He was still in love with her and tried to keep her in the kingdom ; but 
 the result was that Ludwig himself was forced to abdicate .' (1), '#husband# Her husband was drowned , and she 
 made still another marriage .' (1), '#biographies# Fourteen biographies of her have been written , besides her own 
 autobiography , which was called The Story of a Penitent , and which tells 
 less about her than any of the other books .' (1), '#she# Yet all that one can say of her was said by the elder Dumas when 
 he declared that she was born to be the evil genius of every one who 
 cared for her .' (1), '#it# The period of his political career lasted for 
 little more than a decade , yet in that time it may be said that he 
 lived almost a life of fifty years .' (1), '#body# Only a short time ago did the French 
 government cause his body to be placed within the great Pantheon , which 
 contains memorials of the heroes and heroines of France .' (1), '#who# Gambetta , who was born at Cahors , was French only on his mother 's side , 
 since his father was of Italian birth .' (1), '#It# It is said also that somewhere in 
 his ancestry there was a touch of the Oriental .' (1), '#he# At twenty - one he had already been admitted to the French bar , and 
 had drifted to Paris , where his audacity , his pushing nature , and his 
 red - hot un - restraint of speech gave him a certain notoriety from the 
 very first .' (1), '#hair# A man of powerful frame and 
 of intense vitality , with thick , clustering hair , which he shook as 
 a lion shakes its mane ; olive - skinned , with eyes that darted fire , a 
 resonant , sonorous voice , and a personal magnetism which was instantly 
 felt by all who met him or who heard him speak .' (1), '#habits# He was by no means 
 the sort of man whose habits had been formed in drawing - rooms or among 
 people of good breeding .' (1), '#Gambetta# In 1869 Gambetta was elected by the Red Republicans to the Corps 
 Legislatif .' (1), '#chamber# The chamber itself was arranged like a great theater , the 
 members occupying the floor and the public the galleries .' (1), '#he# One may excuse this only on the ground that he was completely carried 
 away by his emotion , so that to him there was no one present save this 
 enigmatically fascinating woman and himself .' (1), '#note# When Gambetta 's note was brought to her she took it quietly 
 and tore it into little pieces without reading it ; and then , rising , she 
 glided through the crowd and disappeared .' (1), '#empire# In the war the empire was shattered at Sedan .' (1), '#republic# The 
 republic was proclaimed in Paris .' (1), '#capital# The French capital was besieged by

 and Gambetta retired for a moment into private life .' (1), '#scrawl# The scrawl was taken to her by a discreet official , and this time she 
 received the letter , pressed it to her heart , and then slipped it into 
 the bodice of her gown .' (1), '#he# But now his heart was full of 
 hope , for he was convinced with a very deep conviction that somewhere , 
 soon , and in some way he would meet this woman , who had become to him 
 one of the intense realities of his life .' (1), '#everything# She knew that his enemies were many and that everything he did 
 would be used against him .' (1), '#she# Yet one thing he knew absolutely -- that she was made for him and 
 that he must have her for his own .' (1), '#man# This man 
 had been attracted by her beauty , and had seduced her .' (1), '#name# It is 
 doubtful whether the name by which she passed was that which had been 
 given to her at baptism ; but , if so , her true name has never been 
 disclosed .' (1), '#ring# A betrothal ring was purchased ; and 
 then , her conscience being appeased , she gave herself completely to her 
 lover .' (1), '#conscience# A betrothal ring was purchased ; and 
 then , her conscience being appeased , she gave herself completely to her

 of the Chamber of Deputies .' (1), '#it# All this time he and Leonie Leon maintained their intimacy , though it 
 was carefully concealed save from a very few .' (1), '#he# However this may be , early in 1882 , when he was defeated in 
 Parliament on a question which he considered vital , he immediately 
 resigned and turned his back on public life .' (1), '#I# " You promised me , " he said , " that if ever I was defeated and alone you 
 would marry me .' (1), '#It# It is not known what form of marriage' (1), '#he# She may 
 have consented to a civil ceremony ; or he , being now out of public life , 
 may have felt that he could be married by the Church .' (1), '#day# The day for their 
 wedding had been set , and Gambetta was already at Les Jardies .' (1), '#he# But there 
 came a rumor that he had been shot .' (1), '#he# Paris , fond as it was of scandals , immediately spread 
 the tale that he had been shot by a jealous woman .' (1), '#prophecy# The wound was not in itself serious , but now the prophecy of Bismarck 
 was fulfilled .' (1), '#she# She wandered for hours in the forest until she 
 reached a convent , where she was received .' (1), '#Brummel# Even better known to us is George Bryan Brummel , commonly called " Beau 
 Brummel , " who by his friendship with George IV .-- then' (1), '#memory# His memory has been kept alive most of all by 
 Richard Mansfield 's famous impersonation of him .' (1), '#play# The play is based upon 
 the actual facts ; for after Brummel had lost the royal favor he died an 
 insane pauper in the French town of Caen .' (1), '#wallflowers# No " wallflowers " were left 
 neglected when D'Orsay was present .' (1), '#he# Who would have supposed that he was destined to become

 the patron of literary men and of distinguished artists ?' (1), '#d'Orsay# During his firsts visit to London , which has already been mentioned ,

 to live with him and dispense with the marriage ceremony .' (1), '#children# Then , 
 after other children had been born , the lady died , leaving the earl a 
 widower at about the age of forty .' (1), '#story# The earlier story 
 of her still young life must here be told , because her name afterward 
 became famous , and because the tale illustrates wonderfully well the 
 raw , crude , lawless period of the Regency , when England was fighting

 him .' (1), '#she# Here was a chance to provide for one of his daughters ,

 out of hand .' (1), '#she# She returned to her father 's house , where she was received 
 with the bitterest reproaches , but where , at least , she was safe from 
 harm , since her possession of a dowry made her a person of some small 
 importance .' (1), '#he# So he was simply cashiered and obliged to leave the

 could get it , without feeling bound to give anything in return .' (1), '#prospects# Sir Leslie points out that until Swift became dean of St. 
 Patrick 's his income was far too small to marry on , and that after his 
 brilliant but disappointing three years in London , when his prospects of

 and in expensive clothing , even though he took no thought of neatness , 
 so that his garments were almost always rumpled and wrinkled from his 
 frequent writhings on couches and on the floor .' (1), '#It# It is related that he 
 composed one of his finest poems--"The Cenci "-- in Italy , while stretched 
 out with face upturned to an almost tropical sun .' (1), '#he# Common sense should have 
 led some one to box Harriet 's ears and send her off to school without a

 known to suffer from .' (1), '#everything# Now that everything has been written that is likely to be written by

 ancient lords of a Scottish manor .' (1), '#son# At that time in Scotland , as in Puritan New England , in each family the 
 son who had the most notable " pairts " was sent to the university that 
 he might become a clergyman .' (1), '#he# His quick sensibility , the way in 
 which he acquired every sort of learning , his command of logic , and , 
 withal , his swift , unerring gift of language , made it certain from the 
 very first that he must be sent to the university as soon as he had 
 finished school , and could afford to go .' (1), '#Scotsman# One hesitates to credit these so - called 
 reminiscences which tell how he absorbed mountains of Greek and immense 
 quantities of political economy and history and sociology and various 
 forms of metaphysics , as every Scotsman is bound to do .' (1), '#he# When he had completed about half of his divinity course , he assured 
 himself that he was not intended for the life of a clergyman .' (1), '#girl# This girl was regarded in her native town as something of a personage .' (1), '#what# To read what has been written of her , one might suppose that she was 
 almost a miracle of birth and breeding , and of intellect as well .' (1), '#Carlyle# Her father was the local doctor , and while she had a 
 comfortable home , and doubtless a chaise at her disposal , she was 
 very far from the " opulence " Carlyle , looking up at her from his

 Miss Welsh .' (1), '#thing# Or how is one thing more 
 inspired than another ?' (1), '#he# At one time , she asked Irving about some German works , and 
 he was obliged to send her to Carlyle to solve her difficulties .' (1), '#he# Carlyle 
 knew German almost as well as if he had been born in Dresden ; and 
 the full and almost overflowing way in which he answered her gave her 
 another impression of his potency .' (1), '#She# She was flattered by Carlyle 's strong 
 preference for her .' (1), '#She# She was perhaps repelled by Irving 's engagement to 
 another woman ; yet at the time few persons thought that she had chosen 
 well .' (1), '#landscape# The landscape

 heather , with peat bogs in the hollows between them .' (1), '#description# Froude 's grim description has been questioned by some ; yet the actual 
 pictures that have been drawn of the place in later years make it

 those of Carlyle 's brother , Alexander , who lived in a cottage near by .' (1), '#what# Before long there came a period of trouble , which is easily explained 
 by what has been already said .' (1), '#tongue# His wife 's sharp tongue , and the gnawings of his own 
 dyspepsia , were lived down with true Scottish grimness .' (1), '#husband# A shivering , palpitating , fiercely loyal bit of humanity , she took it 
 into her head that her husband was infatuated with Lady Ashburton , or 
 that Lady Ashburton was infatuated with him .' (1), '#Ashburton# A shivering , palpitating , fiercely loyal bit of humanity , she took it 
 into her head that her husband was infatuated with Lady Ashburton , or 
 that Lady Ashburton was infatuated with him .' (1), '#years# His last fifteen years were spent in wretchedness and 
 despair .' (1), '#selfishness# But when he had grown to be a very old 
 man , he came to feel that this was all a sort of penance , and that the 
 selfishness of his past must be expiated in the future .' (1), '#cause# But again 
 another cause of discontent was stated in the implication that Carlyle , 
 in his bursts of temper , actually abused his wife .' (1), '#Carlyle# Mrs. Carlyle was accustomed , in private , to speak of Miss Jewsbury as 
 " Miss Gooseberry , " while Carlyle himself said that she was simply " a 
 flimsy tatter of a creature . "' (1), '#Carlyle# Some of the letters which Lady Ashburton wrote 
 Carlyle have been destroyed , but not before her husband had perused 
 them .' (1), '#set# Another set of letters had never been read by Lord Ashburton at 
 all , and they are still preserved -- friendly , harmless , usual letters .' (1), '#they# Another set of letters had never been read by Lord Ashburton at 
 all , and they are still preserved -- friendly , harmless , usual letters .' (1), '#who# It seems most fitting to remember Thomas Carlyle as a man of strength , 
 of honor , and of intellect ; and his wife as one who was sorely tried , 
 but who came out of her suffering into the arms of death , purified and 
 calm and worthy to be remembered by her husband 's side .' (1), '#criticisms# THE STORY OF THE HUGOS 
 Victor Hugo , after all criticisms have been made , stands as a literary 
 colossus .' (1), '#novels# His 
 novels , even when translated , are read and reread by people of every 
 degree of education .' (1), '#he# His gifts were varied , and he knew 
 thoroughly the life and thought of his own countrymen ; and , therefore , 
 in his later days he was almost deified by them .' (1), '#Hugo# Victor Hugo was born in February , 1802 , during the Napoleonic wars , and 
 his early years were spent among the camps and within the sound of the 
 cannon - thunder .' (1), '#years# Victor Hugo was born in February , 1802 , during the Napoleonic wars , and 
 his early years were spent among the camps and within the sound of the 
 cannon - thunder .' (1), '#he# It was fitting that he should have been born and reared 
 in an age of upheaval , revolt , and battle .' (1), '#story# We must remember , also , that he was French , so 
 that his story may be interpreted in the light of the French character .' (1), '#he# At the age of fifteen he was domiciled in Paris , and though still a 
 schoolboy and destined for the study of law , he dreamed only of poetry 
 and of literature .' (1), '#it# Although poetry , then as now , was not 
 very profitable even when it was admired , one of his slender volumes 
 brought him the sum of seven hundred francs , which seemed to him 
 not only a fortune in itself , but the forerunner of still greater 
 prosperity .' (1), '#he# Victor Hugo was often a guest at the 
 apartments of M. Foucher , where he was received by that gentleman 
 and his family .' (1), '#It# It was very well understood , 
 in the course of a few months , that Victor Hugo was in love with Adele 
 Foucher .' (1), '#he# With his supreme 
 self - confidence , he declared that he was bound to be successful , and 
 that in a very short time he would be illustrious .' (1), '#who# Fortunately for him , his poems had attracted 
 the attention of Louis XVIII , who was flattered by some of the verses .' (1), '#people# At any rate , he withdrew his opposition , and the two young 
 people were married in October , 1822 - -both of them being under age , 
 unformed , and immature .' (1), '#sort# This sort of man , in 
 English - speaking lands , is set down simply as a cad , and is excluded

 have been restrained by self - respect and good taste .' (1), '#intimacy# Their intimacy was ended .' (1), '#she# That 
 Hugo did not repudiate her makes it fairly plain that she was innocent ; 
 yet a high - spirited , sensitive soul like Hugo 's could never forget that 
 in the world 's eye she was compromised .' (1), '#It# It may perhaps be doubted whether he would in any case have remained 
 faithful all his life .' (1), '#gage# His range in all things -- mental , physical , and spiritual -- was so far 
 beyond the ordinary that the gage of average can not be applied to him .' (1), '#veil# A veil was drawn , as it were , from before his eyes , and he 
 looked on other women and found them beautiful .' (1), '#Borgia# It was in 1833 , soon after Hugo 's play " Lucrece Borgia " had been 
 accepted for production , that a lady called one morning at Hugo 's house 
 in the Place Royale .' (1), '#she# The name upon 
 her visiting - card was " Mme . Drouet " ; and by this name she had been known 
 in Paris as a clever and somewhat gifted actress .' (1), '#she# At nineteen , after she had been cast upon the world , dowered with that 
 terrible combination , poverty and beauty , she had lived openly with a 
 sculptor named Pradier .' (1), '#characters# The dramatist was willing , but 
 unfortunately all the major characters had been provided for , and he 
 was able to offer her only the minor one of the Princesse Negroni .' (1), '#he# He resolved to see her again ; and he 
 did so , time after time , until he was thoroughly captivated by her .' (1), '#Hugo# Hugo was overwhelmed by her .' (1), '#debts# He found that she was in debt , and 
 he managed to see that her debts were paid .' (1), '#fact# The fact of their intimate connection became gradually known through 
 Paris .' (1), '#It# It was known even to Mme .' (1), '#picture# A very curious and poignant picture of her just before her death has

 been given by the pen of a visitor in Guernsey .' (1), '#Hugo# If so , Adele Hugo was more than punished .' (1), '#who# Suffer she did ; for after her 
 devotion to Hugo had become sincere and deep , he betrayed her confidence 
 by an intrigue with a girl who is spoken of as " Claire . "' (1), '#poet# She 
 died only a short time before the poet himself was laid to rest in Paris 
 with magnificent obsequies which an emperor might have envied .' (1), '#it# Perhaps it is best regarded simply 
 as a chapter in the strange life - histories of men of genius .' (1), '#we# She might even challenge Hugo , because where he depicts strange and 
 monstrous figures , exaggerated beyond the limits of actual life , George 
 Sand portrays living men and women , whose instincts and desires she 
 understands , and whom she makes us see precisely as if we were admitted 
 to their intimacy .' (1), '#who# His daughter , 
 who was born in 1804 , used afterward to boast that on one side she was 
 sprung from kings and nobles , while on the other she was a daughter 
 of the people , able , therefore , to understand the sentiments of the 
 aristocracy and of the children of the soil , or even of the gutter .' (1), '#she# It 
 was the child 's aunt who brought the news , with the joyous comment : 
 " She will be lucky , for she was born among the roses and to the sound of 
 music . "' (1), '#she# Lieutenant Dupin was on the 
 staff of Prince Murat , and little Aurore , as she was called , at the age 
 of three accompanied the army , as did her mother .' (1), '#she# But all this soon passed , and she was presently sent to live with 
 her grandmother at the estate now intimately associated with her 
 name -- Nohant , in the valley of the Indre , in the midst of a rich 
 country , a love for which she then drank in so deeply that nothing in 
 her later life could lessen it .' (1), '#she# At Nohant she was given over to her grand - mother , to be reared in a 
 strangely desultory sort of fashion , doing and reading and studying 
 those things which could best develop her native gifts .' (1), '#father# Her father , however , was killed by a fall from a horse ; and then the 
 child grew up almost without any formal education .' (1), '#mother# Her only sorrow was the fact that her mother was excluded from Nohant .' (1), '#life# This life was adapted to her nature .' (1), '#grandmother# There was no one to control her , because her 
 grandmother was confined to her own room .' (1), '#she# As the girl 
 was still but seventeen , she was placed under the guardianship of the 
 nearest relative on her father 's side -- a gentleman of rank .' (1), '#it# Yet in the long run it was bound to be a 
 mistake .' (1), '#marriage# He 
 had , however , a sort of jollity about him which appealed to this girl of 
 eighteen ; and so a marriage was arranged .' (1), '#she# Aurore Dudevant really believed that she was swayed by a pure and mystic 
 passion .' (1), '#he# Coming to visit her at Nohant , he was revolted by the 
 clownish husband with whom she lived .' (1), '#package# Since the 
 package was addressed to me , it was not dishonorable for me to open it .' (1), '#she# She had some friends who helped her as well as they 
 could , but though she was attached to the Figaro , her earnings for the 
 first month amounted to only fifteen francs .' (1), '#she# Even before she left her husband , she was credited 
 with having four lovers ; but all she said , when the report was brought 
 to her , was this : " Four lovers are none too many for one with such 
 lively passions as mine . "' (1), '#report# Even before she left her husband , she was credited 
 with having four lovers ; but all she said , when the report was brought 
 to her , was this : " Four lovers are none too many for one with such 
 lively passions as mine . "' (1), '#they# According to her , the ties between a man and a woman are sacred only 
 when they are sanctified by love ; and she distinguished between love and 
 passion in this epigram : 
 Love seeks to give , while passion seeks to take .' (1), '#mouth# Her eyes were 
 somewhat projecting , and her mouth was almost sullen when in repose .' (1), '#she# When she was deeply stirred , however , she burst forth into an 
 extraordinary vivacity , showing a nature richly endowed and eager to 
 yield its treasures .' (1), '#It# It will be found all through her career , not only that 
 she sought to inspire passion , but that she strove to gratify it after 
 fashions of her own .' (1), '#who# He was , in fact , the first writer of fiction who was 
 admitted to the French Academy .' (1), '#who# She shunned men , and sought the friendship of Marie 
 Dorval , a clever actress who was destined afterward to break the heart 
 of Alfred de Vigny .' (1), '#instincts# Merimee had a certain fascination of manner , 
 and the predatory instincts of George Sand were again aroused .' (1), '#he# When Merimee left Nohant , he was destined never again to 
 see George Sand , except long afterward at a dinner - party , where the two 
 stared at each other sharply , but did not speak .' (1), '#she# Returning thither , she is said to have set her cap at Victor Hugo , 
 who was , however , too much in love with himself to care for any one , 
 especially a woman who was his literary rival .' (1), '#She# She is said for a time to 
 have been allied with Gustave Planche , a dramatic critic ; but she 
 always denied this , and her denial may be taken as quite truthful .' (1), '#denial# She is said for a time to 
 have been allied with Gustave Planche , a dramatic critic ; but she 
 always denied this , and her denial may be taken as quite truthful .' (1), '#he# Young Alfred was nervous , 
 delicate , slightly epileptic , and it is certain that he was given to 
 dissipation , which so far had affected his health only by making 
 him hysterical .' (1), '#she# She accepted the relations between them , but that she should be asked 
 to sanction this sort of affair was rather too much , even for a French 
 mother who has become accustomed to many strange things .' (1), '#she# She also declared that she herself was born within 
 a month of her parents ' wedding - day .' (1), '#she# As for 
 Musset , she was supposed whose heart to have broken , within a year he 
 was dangling after the famous singer , Mme .' (1), '#it# After this episode with Pagello , it can not be said that the life of 
 George Sand was edifying in any respect , because no one can assume that 
 she was sincere .' (1), '#love# She was 
 a good deal taken with a noisy demagogue named Michel , a lawyer at 
 Bourges , who on one occasion shut her up in her room and harangued her 
 on sociology until she was as weary of his talk as of his wooden shoes , 
 his shapeless greatcoat , his spectacles , and his skull - cap , Balzac felt 
 her fascination , but cared nothing for her , since his love was given to 
 Mme .' (1), '#It# It is estimated that 
 her whole gains amounted to about a million francs , extending over a 
 period of forty - five years .' (1), '#It# It has been said of Feuillet that he was a sort of " domesticated 
 Musset . "' (1), '#he# She had known him for two years , and had not seriously thought of him , 
 though there is a story that when she first met him she kissed him 
 before he had even been presented to her .' (1), '#she# Acting as sick 
 nurse , writing herself with rheumatic fingers , robbed by every one about 
 her , and viewed with suspicion by the peasants because she did not go 
 to church , she may be perhaps excused for her sharp words when , in fact , 
 her deeds were kind .' (1), '#he# One remembers , for instance , how he was called in to arbitrate between 
 Thackeray and George Augustus Sala , who had quarreled .' (1), '#she# Crushing pieces of ice between her teeth in 
 agony , she would speak to him and he would answer her in his rich , manly 
 tones until she was comforted and felt able to endure more hours of pain 
 without complaint .' (1), '#it# But as for his own life , it 
 seemed so normal , so free from anything approaching mystery , that we can 
 scarcely believe it to have been tinged with darker colors than those 
 which appeared upon the surface .' (1), '#it# To be sure , this is a chapter that is writ large in all of his 
 biographies , and yet it is nowhere correctly told .' (1), '#I# I was only struck at first with one thing -- and I made a memorandum of 
 it the degree to which the poor author was 
 overpowered with the honor of his publisher 's visit that evening as the strongest instance I had seen of English 
 obsequiousness to employers -- !' (1), '#degree# I was only struck at first with one thing -- and I made a memorandum of 
 it the degree to which the poor author was 
 overpowered with the honor of his publisher 's visit that evening as the strongest instance I had seen of English 
 obsequiousness to employers -- !' (1), '#Dickens# Dickens was dressed very much as he has since described Dick Swiveller , 
 minus the swell look .' (1), '#hair# His hair was cropped close to his head , his 
 clothes scant , though jauntily cut , and , after changing a ragged 
 office - coat for a shabby blue , he stood by the door , collarless and 
 buttoned up , the very personification of a close sailer to the wind .' (1), '#It# It has been generally supposed that no love - affair entered his life 
 until he met Catherine Hogarth , whom he married soon after making her 
 acquaintance .' (1), '#It# It was left to an 
 American to disclose the fact that this was not the case , but that even 
 in his teens he had been captivated by a girl of about his own age .' (1), '#he# It was left to an 
 American to disclose the fact that this was not the case , but that even 
 in his teens he had been captivated by a girl of about his own age .' (1), '#Everything# Everything that is known about his first affair is contained in a book 
 very beautifully printed , but inaccessible to most readers .' (1), '#Beadnell# This man had in his stock a number of letters which had passed 
 between a Miss Maria Beadnell and Charles Dickens when the two were 
 about nineteen and a second package of letters representing a later 
 acquaintance , about 1855 , at which time Miss Beadnell had been married 
 for a long time to a Mr. Henry Louis Winter , of 12 Artillery Place , 
 London .' (1), '#copies# A few additional copies were struck off , 
 but these did not bear the Bibliophile book - plate .' (1), '#they# Only two copies are 
 available for other readers , and to peruse these it is necessary to 
 visit the Congressional Library in Washington , where they were placed on 
 July 24 , 1908 .' (1), '#who# Another shows her in 
 1855 , when she writes of herself as " old and fat "-- thereby doing herself 
 a great deal of injustice ; for although she had lost her youthful 
 beauty , she was a very presentable woman of middle age , but one who 
 would not be particularly noticed in any company .' (1), '#it# Summing up briefly these different letters , it may be said that in 
 the first set Dickens wrote to the lady ardently , but by no means 
 passionately .' (1), '#character# It is a dangerous thing to say from whom any character in 
 a novel is drawn .' (1), '#novel# It is a dangerous thing to say from whom any character in 
 a novel is drawn .' (1), '#husband# There is little 
 reason to think that the most intimate friends of Dickens and of his 
 family were mistaken through all the years when they were certain that 
 the boy husband and the girl wife of David Copperfield were suggested by 
 any one save Dickens himself and Catherine Hogarth .' (1), '#It# It was believed for a long time -- in fact , until their separation -- that 
 Dickens and his wife were extremely happy in their home life .' (1), '#passage# A passage or two may be quoted from the novel , so that we may set them 
 beside passages in Dickens 's own life , we know which to have referred to 
 his own wife , and not to any such nebulous person as Mrs. Winter .' (1), '#It# It was deepened , if it were changed at all ; 
 but it was as undefined as ever , and addressed me like a strain of 
 sorrowful music faintly heard in the night .' (1), '#it# It was deepened , if it were changed at all ; 
 but it was as undefined as ever , and addressed me like a strain of 
 sorrowful music faintly heard in the night .' (1), '#I# His next letter draws the veil and shows plainly what he means : 
 Poor Catherine and I are not made for each other , and there is no help 
 for it .' (1), '#she# Then he goes on to say that she would have been a thousand times happier 
 if she had been married to another man .' (1), '#statement# Mr. Smith naturally thought that the statement was intended for 
 publication , but Dickens always spoke of it as " the violated letter . "' (1), '#he# He had grown out of the sphere in which 
 he had been born , " associated with blacking - boys and quilt - printers , " 
 and had become one of the great men of his time , whose genius was 
 universally admired .' (1), '#jealousy# Mr. Bigelow saw Mrs. Dickens as she really was -- a commonplace woman 
 endowed with the temper of a vixen , and disposed to outbursts of actual 
 violence when her jealousy was roused .' (1), '#who# The actresses who have been often mentioned 
 in connection with his name were , for the most part , mere passing 
 favorites .' (1), '#pages# In the 
 selection you have made I find that only two pages are given to George 
 P. Morris , while you have n't given E. P. Roe any space at all !' (1), '#Balzac# Balzac was born in 1799 , at Tours , with all the traits of the people 
 of his native province -- fond of eating and drinking , and with plenty of 
 humor .' (1), '#he# Then he was brought home , apparently much prostrated , 
 although the good fathers could find nothing physically amiss with him , 
 and nothing in his studies to account for his agitation .' (1), '#what# For some reason , when these years were over , the boy began to have what 
 is so often known as " a call "-- a sort of instinct that he was to attain 
 renown .' (1), '#part# This was the more grievous , since a great part of the family property 
 had been lost .' (1), '#Balzacs# The Balzacs were afflicted by actual poverty , and Honore 
 endeavored , with his pen , to beat the wolf back from the door .' (1), '#he# He was sure that he was called to 
 literature , and yet he was not sure that he had the power to succeed .' (1), '#he# Here we see how little he had been daunted by ill success , and how his 
 prodigious imagination had not been overcome by sorrow and evil fortune .' (1), '#imagination# Here we see how little he had been daunted by ill success , and how his 
 prodigious imagination had not been overcome by sorrow and evil fortune .' (1), '#Balzac# Balzac was greatly stirred by its keen and sympathetic 
 criticism .' (1), '#authorship# Other letters followed , and after a while their authorship was made 
 known to Balzac .' (1), '#they# He learned that they had been written by a young Polish 
 lady , Mme .' (1), '#It# It is said that she had no sooner raised her face , and looked him 
 fully in the eyes , than she fell fainting to the floor , overcome by 
 her emotion .' (1), '#Balzac# Balzac himself was deeply moved .' (1), '#board# Every sign - board , every door - plate , every affiche 
 upon the walls , was scrutinized .' (1), '#affiche# Every sign - board , every door - plate , every affiche 
 upon the walls , was scrutinized .' (1), '#Thousands# Thousands of names were considered 
 and rejected , and it was only after his companion , utterly worn out by 
 fatigue , had flatly refused to drag his weary limbs through more than 
 one additional street , that Balzac suddenly saw upon a sign the name 
 " Marcas , " and gave a shout of joy at having finally secured what he was 
 seeking .' (1), '#Balzac# In many ways Balzac and Evelina Hanska were mated by nature .' (1), '#they# Whether 
 they were fully mated the facts of their lives must demonstrate .' (1), '#process# This process 
 was repeated several times ; and how expensive it was may be judged from 
 the fact that his bill for " author 's proof corrections " was sometimes 
 more than the publishers had agreed to pay him for the completed volume .' (1), '#strain# It is the most startling proof of his immense vitality , both physical 
 and mental , that so tremendous an emotional strain could be endured 
 by him for years without exhausting his fecundity or blighting his 
 creativeness .' (1), '#it# Even in Balzac one notices toward the last a certain sense 
 of strain underlying what he wrote , a certain lack of elasticity and 
 facility , if of nothing more ; yet on the whole it is likely that without 
 this friendship Balzac would have been less great than he actually 
 became , as it is certain that had it been broken off' (1), '#explanation# Perhaps the explanation , if we may venture upon 
 one , is based upon a well - known physiological fact .' (1), '#Love# Love in its completeness is made up of two great elements -- first , the 
 element that is wholly spiritual , that is capable of sympathy , and 
 tenderness , and deep emotion .' (1), '#union# Therefore , she shrank from his proximity , and from 
 his physical contact , and it was perhaps better for them both that their 
 union was so quickly broken off by death ; for the great novelist died of 
 heart disease only five months after the marriage .' (1), '#what# A 
 few of these instances may , perhaps , represent what is usually called 
 a Platonic union .' (1), '#lord# He was the son of a country gentleman , the lord of a manor which had 
 been held by his family before the Wars of the Boses .' (1), '#he# At the same time he might very well have been called a Tory democrat .' (1), '#nature# A weaker nature would have been 
 crushed .' (1), '#Reade# Reade 's was toughened , and he learned to resist pain and to 
 resent wrong , so that hatred of injustice has been called his dominating 
 trait .' (1), '#hatred# Reade 's was toughened , and he learned to resist pain and to 
 resent wrong , so that hatred of injustice has been called his dominating 
 trait .' (1), '#what# For his college at Oxford , Reade selected one of the most beautiful 
 and ancient -- Magdalen -- which he entered , securing what is known as a 
 demyship .' (1), '#candidate# At that 
 time every candidate was supposed to be able to repeat , by heart , the 
 " Thirty - Nine Articles . "' (1), '#he# Reade rattled them 
 off with the greatest glibness , and produced so favorable an impression 
 that he was let go without any further questioning .' (1), '#It# It must be added that his English essay was original , and this also 
 helped him ; but had it not been for the other great piece of luck he 
 would , in Oxford phrase , have been " completely gulfed .' (1), '#he# " As it was , 
 however , he was placed as highly as the young men who were afterward 
 known as Cardinal Newman and Sir Robert Lowe ( Lord Sherbrooke ) .' (1), '#chambers# He might spend his time 
 in London , or even outside of England , knowing that his chambers at 
 Magdalen were kept in order for him , as a resting - place to which he 
 might return whenever he chose .' (1), '#scarfs# His flaring scarfs were viewed as being 
 almost scandalous , very much as Longfellow 's parti - colored waistcoats 
 were regarded when he first came to Harvard as a professor .' (1), '#waistcoats# His flaring scarfs were viewed as being 
 almost scandalous , very much as Longfellow 's parti - colored waistcoats 
 were regarded when he first came to Harvard as a professor .' (1), '#himself# On his tombstone 
 he caused himself to be described as " Dramatist , novelist , journalist . "' (1), '#Plays# Plays were bought 
 outright by the managers , who were afraid to risk any considerable sum , 
 and were very shy about risking anything at all .' (1), '#system# The system had not yet 
 been established according to which an author receives a share of the 
 money taken at the box - office .' (1), '#he# He adapted several pieces from the French , for which 
 he was paid a few bank - notes .' (1), '#Reade# Reade was personally liked , but his plays were 
 almost all rejected .' (1), '#something# A friend of his -- a Jewish gentleman of Portuguese 
 extraction -- showed much kindness to the children , settling their affairs 
 and leaving them with some money in the bank ; but , of course , something 
 must be done .' (1), '#she# The two daughters removed to London , and at a very early age Laura had 
 made for herself a place in the dramatic world , taking small parts at 
 first , but rising so rapidly that in her fifteenth year she was cast 
 for the part of Juliet .' (1), '#She# She has been described as " a fluttering , buoyant , gorgeous little 
 butterfly . "' (1), '#name# She was careless of what she did , 
 and her name was not untouched with scandal .' (1), '#Reade# Reade was stung to the quick .' (1), '#she# Her husband , Mr. Seymour , died not long after she and Reade

 churchyard .' (1), '#grave# This grave was made for her and for himself by Charles Reade , whose wise 
 counselor , loyal ally , and bosom friend she was for twenty - four years , 
 and who mourns her all his days .' (1)

 two might well love ; and he gave her every chance to show him favor .' (1), '#her# The royal prince who would have given her his easy love lived a life of 
 far less dignity in the years that followed his return to France .' (1), '#her# She influenced 
 him for all that was good , and he used to say that he owed her all that 
 was best in his dramatic works .' (1), '#Catharine# With a sort of psychopathic 
 perversity he would insist on giving Catharine the most minute and 
 repulsive narratives of his amours , until she shrank from him with 
 horror at his depravity and came to loathe the sight of his bloated 
 face , with its little , twinkling , porcine eyes , his upturned nose 
 and distended nostrils , and his loose - hung , lascivious mouth .' (1), '#him# The 
 infidelities of Peter gradually made her feel that she owed him nothing 
 as his wife .' (1), '#him# Historians have 
 given him much credit for two great reforms that are connected with his 
 name ; and yet the manner in which they were actually brought about is 
 rather ludicrous .' (1), '#you# Prove that you are worthy of the faith which I and others have given you 
 so loyally ! "' (1), '#him# Within two years after their 
 intimate acquaintance had begun she had given him nine million rubles , 
 while afterward he accepted almost limitless estates in Poland and in 
 every province of Greater Russia .' (1), '#himself# He built himself a great palace in St. Petersburg , 
 usually known as the Taurian Palace , and there he gave the most 
 sumptuous entertainments , reversing the story of Antony and Cleopatra .' (1), '#him# Catharine had given him a magnificent triumph , and he had entertained 
 her in his Taurian Palace with a splendor such as even Russia had never 
 known before .' (1), '#her# Lady Jackson describes her as having a long , thin face , small , 
 pig - like eyes , a pinched - up mouth , with the heavy Hapsburg lip , and 
 with a somewhat misshapen form , so that for years she had to be bandaged 
 tightly to give her a more natural figure .' (1), '#her# Had he shown her the affection of a husband she 
 might have loved him .' (1), '#her# After four 
 years of marriage , as Mrs. Mayne records , he had only reached the point 
 of giving her a chilly kiss .' (1), '#himself# In all this confusion Burr showed 
 himself a man of mettle .' (1), '#me# Write me all that I have asked , and a hundred things which I have 
 not .' (1), '#myself# I shall always be too gallant to show myself 
 ungrateful for the favor . "' (1), '#advice# For my own part , I never did nor do I believe I ever shall give advice 
 to a woman who is setting out on a matrimonial voyage ...' (1), '#them# He should have destroyed them 
 unopened , and should never have mentioned them in his memoirs of the man 
 who trusted him as a friend .' (1), '#him# She had known him a good many years before ; and , though he was now 
 seventy - eight years of age , there was no perceptible change in him .' (1), '#me# " I shall come to you before very long , " he said , " accompanied by a 
 clergyman ; and then you will give me your hand because I want it . "' (1), '#him# He besought his young cousin , as 
 head of the family , to grant him this privilege of marriage ; but Queen 
 Victoria stubbornly refused .' (1), '#her# Not long after he first met her the prince , who was 
 always given to private theatricals , sent messengers riding in hot haste 
 to her house to tell her that he had stabbed himself , that he begged 
 to see her , and that unless she came he would repeat the act .' (1), '#himself# George certainly felt himself a husband .' (1), '#me# It is said that as he 
 took her hand he kissed her , and then , suddenly recoiling , he whispered 
 to one of his friends : 
 " For God 's sake , George , give me a glass of brandy ! "' (1), '#him# During his last 
 illness she had sent him an affectionate missive which it is said George 
 " read eagerly . "' (1), '#us# This passport still exists , and it gives us an official 
 description of the girl .' (1), '#me# Be so good as to receive me and give me a brief interview .' (1), '#her# If she were able to answer that she had several the emperor would look 
 pleased and would pay her some compliment ; but if she said that she had 
 none he would turn upon her sharply and say : 
 " Then go home and have some ! "' (1), '#him# , first must come Of the four women who influenced his life Josephine , 
 because she secured him his earliest chance of advancement .' (1), '#him# She was his first love , and his knowledge of her perfidy gave him the 
 greatest shock and horror of his whole life ; yet she might have held him 
 to the end if she had borne an heir to the imperial throne .' (1), '#him# It was amusing to throw him 
 into one of his violent rages ; but Pauline was true at heart , and when 
 her great brother was sent to Elba she followed him devotedly and gave 
 him all her store of jewels , including the famous Borghese diamonds , 
 perhaps the most superb of all gems known to the western world .' (1), '#him# But Napoleon was not the sort of man to forget anything that had given 
 him either pleasure or the reverse .' (1), '#her# Murmurs of admiration followed her , and finally Poniatowski came to her 
 and complimented her , besides bringing her a message that the emperor 
 desired her to dance with him .' (1), '#you# I order you to rise at once and receive these 
 ladies and gentlemen who have done you so much honor ! "' (1), '#her# It was not wholly distasteful thus to have the 
 conqueror of the world seek her out and offer her his adoration any 
 more than it was distasteful to think that the revival of her own nation 
 depended on her single will .' (1), '#him# M. Frederic Masson , whose minute studies 
 regarding everything relating to Napoleon have won him a seat in the 
 French Academy , writes of Marie Walewska at this time :' (1), '#me# Just as I dash it to 
 fragments before you , so will I shatter Poland if you drive me to 
 desperation by rejecting my heart and refusing me your own . "' (1), '#me# He himself once 
 declared : 
 " My family have done me far more harm than I have been able to do them 
 good . "' (1), '#them# He himself once 
 declared : 
 " My family have done me far more harm than I have been able to do them 
 good . "' (1), '#her# Napoleon made Elise a princess in her own right and gave her the Grand 
 Duchy of Tuscany .' (1), '#them# The future emperor was then a captain of artillery and could give them 
 but little out of his scanty pay .' (1), '#him# She used to write him love 
 letters in Italian , which were certainly not lacking in ardor .' (1), '#her# But her love affairs never 
 gave her any serious trouble ; and the three sisters , who now began to 
 feel the influence of Napoleon 's rise to power , enjoyed themselves as 
 they had never done before .' (1), '#him# When he was buried she , still 
 recovering from her fever , had him interred in a costly coffin and paid 
 him the tribute of cutting off her beautiful hair and burying it with 
 him .' (1), '#himself# To her Napoleon showed himself far more severe than with either Caroline 
 or Elise .' (1), '#her# He gave her a marriage dowry of half a million francs when she 
 became the Princess Borghese , but after that he was continually checking 
 her extravagances .' (1), '#him# Nevertheless , she tried to sell all her trinkets , of 
 which she was so proud , in order that she might give him help .' (1), '#herself# This that she was unfaithful to Napoleon , that 
 she abandoned him in the hour of his defeat , and that she gave herself 
 with readiness to one inferior in rank , yet with whom she lived for 
 years , and to whom she bore what a French writer styled " a brood of 
 bastards is almost all that 
 is usually remembered of her -- . "' (1), '#him# And then Josephine had never borne him any children ; and without a 
 son to perpetuate his dynasty , the gigantic achievements which he 
 had wrought seemed futile in his eyes , and likely to crumble into 
 nothingness when he should die .' (1), '#you# To the girl he was whom to marry he sent the following letter -- an odd 
 letter , combining the formality of a negotiator with the veiled ardor of 
 a lover : 
 MY COUSIN : The brilliant qualities which adorn your person have inspired 
 in me a desire to serve you and to pay you homage .' (1), '#me# God has given me power to 
 endure this final shock , and in Him alone I have put all my trust .' (1), '#me# He 
 will help me and give me courage , and I shall find support in doing my 
 duty toward you , since it is all for you that I have sacrificed myself .' (1), '#him# But after all had been arranged -- even to the illuminations , the 
 cheering , the salutes , and the etiquette of the court -- he fell into a 
 fever of impatience which gave him sleepless nights and frantic days .' (1), '#herself# Installed in the Tuileries , she taught herself compliance .' (1), '#What# On their 
 marriage night Napoleon had asked her briefly : " What did your parents 
 tell you ? "' (1), '#you# " I give you leave , " said Napoleon , " to have a private interview with the 
 empress .' (1), '#hearts# According to Masson , he was an Austrian Don Juan , and had won the hearts 
 of many women .' (1), '#him# She 
 had borne him five children ; and in 1813 he had married her in order 
 that these children might be made legitimate .' (1), '#me# The barbarians ( meaning the English authorities at St. Helena ) have 
 carefully prevented him from coming to give me any news respecting 
 them . "' (1), '#school# His learning led him to teach school a few months in the year to the 
 children of the white settlers .' (1), '#me# It was a little more than a month after his marriage when he met a 
 friend , and , taking him out into a strip of quiet woodland , said to him : 
 " I have something to tell you , but you must not ask me anything about 
 it .' (1), '#them# Friends of Mrs. Houston begged her to tell them the 
 meaning of the whole affair .' (1), '#themselves# Again , 
 there were enemies and slanderers of his who , had they shown themselves 
 in Nashville , would have been torn to pieces by men who hailed Houston 
 as a hero and who believed that he could not possibly have done wrong .' (1), '#him# But it is not likely that she objected to his manners , since she had 
 become familiar with them before she gave him her hand ; and as to his 
 conceit , there is no evidence that it was as yet unduly developed .' (1), '#her# The Hindu servants taught her more 
 things than she should have known ; and at one time her stepfather found 
 her performing the danse du ventre .' (1), '#her# One of her numerous admirers told her this .' (1), '#Lola# In less than a month this curious monarch had given Lola the title of 
 Countess of Landsfeld .' (1), '#him# At twenty - one he had already been admitted to the French bar , and 
 had drifted to Paris , where his audacity , his pushing nature , and his 
 red - hot un - restraint of speech gave him a certain notoriety from the 
 very first .' (1), '#him# From the very first his vehemence and fire gained him a 
 ready hearing .' (1), '#them# Yet he was sure that time would bring them 
 close together .' (1), '#her# He urged a 
 civil marriage , but she declared that only a marriage according to the 
 rites of the Church could ever purify her past and give her back her 
 self - respect .' (1), '#her# She lived upon the memories of the past , of the swift love that had come 
 at first sight , but which had lasted unbrokenly ; which had given her the 
 pride of conquest , and which had brought her lover both happiness and 
 inspiration and a refining touch which had smoothed away his roughness 
 and made him fit to stand in palaces with dignity and distinction .' (1), '#lover# She lived upon the memories of the past , of the swift love that had come 
 at first sight , but which had lasted unbrokenly ; which had given her the 
 pride of conquest , and which had brought her lover both happiness and

 king gave Count d'Orsay a commission in the army in a regiment stationed 
 at Valence in the southeastern part of France .' (1), '#them# At the balls given by his regiment , although he was more courted 
 than any other officer , he always sought out the plainest girls and 
 showed them the most flattering attentions .' (1), '#him# On the other hand , he had early 
 inherited a very large property which yielded him an income of about 
 thirty thousand pounds a year .' (1), '#earl# The death of 
 his wife , however , gave the earl a special opportunity to display his 
 extravagant tastes .' (1), '#lady# The Countess of Blessington -- to give the lady her new title -- was now 
 twenty - eight years of age and had developed into a woman of great 
 beauty .' (1), '#itself# Beautiful , full of Celtic vivacity , 
 imaginative and eager , such a nature as hers would in the end be starved 
 unless her heart should be deeply touched and unless all her pent - up 
 emotion could give itself up entirely in the great surrender .' (1), '#us# Memory seldom fails its office is when to show us the tombs of our 
 buried hopes .' (1), '#himself# With these endowments , he plunged into the social whirlpool , denying 
 himself nothing , and receiving everything - adulation , friendship , and 
 unstinted love .' (1), '#woman# Give a woman a looking - glass and burnt almonds , and she 
 will be content .' (1), '#him# For two cantos of " Childe Harold " and 
 " Manfred , " Murray paid him twenty thousand dollars .' (1), '#him# In the first place , it was to be kept secret ; and 
 second , she would not take her husband 's name , but he must pass himself 
 off as her lover , even though she bore him children .' (1), '#you# " Not at all , " said he ; " and we have here only a feeble nucleus of the 
 Marx literature -- just enough , in fact , to give you a glimpse of what 
 that literature really is .' (1), '#us# Doubtless some better - equipped German writer , such as Franz Mehring or 
 Eduard Bernstein , will some day give us the adequate and full biography 
 for which the world now waits .' (1), '#What# What he taught 
 with almost terrific vigor made his very presence in the Continental 
 monarchies a source of eminent danger .' (1), '#me# In answer to his father 's questions , the younger Marx replied : 
 " I have something to tell you that will explain all ; but first you must 
 give me your word that you will tell no one . "' (1), '#girl# The baron knew that such an engagement meant a social sacrifice , 
 and that , apart from the matter of rank , young Marx was without any 
 fortune to give the girl the luxuries to which she had been accustomed .' (1), '#him# Finally Karl received one letter from his betrothed -- a letter that 
 transfused him with ecstatic joy for about a day , and then sent him 
 back to his old unrest .' (1), '#herself# Like Wagner and his Minna , the wife of Marx 's youth clung to him through 
 his utmost vicissitudes , denying herself the necessities of life so that 
 he might not starve .' (1), '#you# If , again , they had been told that Ferdinand Lassalle had joined in the 
 great movement initiated by Karl Marx , it is absolutely certain that 
 neither the Englishman nor the American could have given you the 
 slightest notion as to who these individuals were .' (1), '#boy# He gave the boy a thorough education at 
 the University of Breslau , and later at Berlin .' (1), '#you# Heine wrote to Varnhagen 
 von Ense , the German historian : 
 My friend , Herr Lassalle , who brings you this letter , is a young man of 
 remarkable intellectual gifts .' (1), '#mistress# Lassalle , who had the scent of a greyhound , pried about until he 
 discovered that the count had given his mistress a legal document , 
 assigning to her a valuable piece of property which , in the ordinary 
 course of law , should be entailed on the boy , Paul .' (1), '#himself# From this time Lassalle , with an almost quixotic devotion , gave himself 
 up to fighting the Countess von Hatzfeldt 's battle against her husband 
 in the law - courts .' (1), '#her# She had never heard the 
 name , and yet the sound of it gave her a strange emotion .' (1), '#her# In the midst of the public gathering they almost rushed into 
 each other 's arms ; they talked the free talk of acknowledged lovers ; and 
 when she left , he called her love - names as he offered her his arm .' (1), '#him# When he passed 
 from city to city , the whole population turned out to do him honor .' (1), '#himself# If she were compromised , all the more 
 ought he to have taken her in his arms and married her at once , instead 
 of quibbling and showing himself a prig .' (1), '#him# She wrote him a formal letter to the effect that she had become 
 reconciled to her " betrothed bridegroom " ; and they never met again .' (1), '#her# M. Morin gave her his address and said that he would arrange to have her 
 meet a friend who would be of great service to her .' (1), '#you# " Permit me , mademoiselle , to present it to you in my turn so as to save 
 you the embarrassment of asking for it . "' (1), '#me# " But you will send me 
 back my carriage , wo n't you ? "' (1), '#her# When Swift first met her , Esther Johnson was only eight years old ; and 
 part of his duties at Moor Park consisted in giving her what was then 
 an unusual education for a girl .' (1), '#it# Yet love does not 
 need the spoken word and the formal declaration to give it life and make 
 it deep and strong .' (1), '#him# He had learned the manners of the world , and he carried him self with an 
 air of power which impressed all those who met him .' (1), '#her# Swift did not in any sense make love to her , though he 
 gave her the somewhat fanciful name of " Vanessa " ; but she , driven on by 
 a high - strung , unbridled temperament , made open love to him .' (1), '#her# He told her that they were too unequal in years and fortune for anything 
 but friendship , and he offered to give her as much friendship as she 
 desired .' (1), '#her# Reaching the house , he dashed into it , with 
 something awful in his looks , made his way to Vanessa , threw her letter 
 down upon the table and , after giving her one frightful glare , turned on 
 his heel , and in a moment more was galloping back to Dublin .' (1), '#himself# Sir Leslie points out that until Swift became dean of St. 
 Patrick 's his income was far too small to marry on , and that after his 
 brilliant but disappointing three years in London , when his prospects of 
 advancement were ruined , he felt himself a broken man .' (1), '#them# Passing years simply bring them more closely 
 together , until they have settled down into a sort of domestic unity , 
 by which they think alike , act alike , and even gradually come to look 
 alike .' (1), '#him# His rovings had given him ease 
 and grace , and the power which comes from a wide experience of life .' (1), '#him# It probably 
 disturbed Shelley himself ; but , after all , it gave him some satisfaction 
 to be a martyr for the cause of free speech .' (1), '#him# There are no likenesses of him that do him justice , 
 because they can not convey that singular appeal which the man himself 
 made to almost every one who met him .' (1), '#him# Irving 's seniority gave him a certain 
 prestige with the younger men , and naturally with Miss Welsh .' (1), '#her# Carlyle 
 knew German almost as well as if he had been born in Dresden ; and 
 the full and almost overflowing way in which he answered her gave her 
 another impression of his potency .' (1), '#countrymen# Here , too , he 
 began to teach his countrymen the value of German literature .' (1), '#him# Although poetry , then as now , was not 
 very profitable even when it was admired , one of his slender volumes 
 brought him the sum of seven hundred francs , which seemed to him 
 not only a fortune in itself , but the forerunner of still greater 
 prosperity .' (1), '#Hugo# He sent Hugo five hundred francs for an ode , and soon afterward settled 
 upon him a pension of a thousand francs .' (1), '#him# Hugo , in turn , styled Sainte - Beuve " an eagle , " 
 " a blazing star , " and paid him other compliments no less gorgeous and 
 Hugoesque .' (1), '#him# Hugo are an indelible stain on his memory , and his infamy not 
 only cost him his most precious friendships , but crippled him in every 
 high endeavor .' (1), '#her# The dramatist was willing , but 
 unfortunately all the major characters had been provided for , and he 
 was able to offer her only the minor one of the Princesse Negroni .' (1), '#her# He gave her an allowance that was relatively 
 small , though later he provided for her amply in his will .' (1), '#him# It gave him an esthetic shock to 
 see that she had borne children to this boor .' (1), '#herself# The good opinion of the world is a prostitute who gives herself 
 to the highest bidder .' (1), '#her# The magazine which still exists as the Revue des Deux Mondes 
 gave her a retaining fee of four thousand francs a year , and many other 
 publications begged her to write serial stories for them .' (1), '#Sandeau# She sends Sandeau adoring letters .' (1), '#herself# The two went down into the country ; and there George 
 Sand wrote hour after hour , sitting by her fireside , and showing herself 
 a tender mother to her little daughter Solange .' (1), '#her# She expressed a yearning for the affections of the elder Dumas ; 
 but that good - natured giant laughed at her , and in fact gave her some 
 sound advice , and let her smoke unsentimentally in his study .' (1), '#her# Her fine eyebrows and these great placid eyes gave her an 
 air of strength and dignity which was not borne out by the lower part of 
 her face .' (1), '#herself# Another shows her in 
 1855 , when she writes of herself as " old and fat "-- thereby doing herself 
 a great deal of injustice ; for although she had lost her youthful 
 beauty , she was a very presentable woman of middle age , but one who 
 would not be particularly noticed in any company .' (1), '#tributes# His 
 writings glorified all that was domestic , and paid many tender tributes 
 to the joys of family affection .' (1), '#us# In his Retrospections of an Active Life , 
 Mr. John Bigelow writes a few sentences which are interesting for their 
 frankness , and which give us certain hints : 
 Mrs. Dickens was not a handsome woman , though stout , hearty , and 
 matronly ; there was something a little doubtful about her eye , and 
 I thought her endowed with a temper that might be very violent when 
 roused , though not easily rousable .' (1), '#her# She played in private theatricals 
 with Dickens , and he sent her a portrait in a brooch , which met with 
 an accident requiring it to be sent to the jeweler 's to be mended .' (1), '#him# He became a pleasure - lover ; but more than that , he needed one who could 
 understand his moods and match them , one who could please his tastes , 
 and one who could give him that admiration he felt which to be his due ; 
 for he was always anxious to be praised , and his letters are full of 
 anecdotes relating to his love of praise .' (1), '#Roe# In the 
 selection you have made I find that only two pages are given to George 
 P. Morris , while you have n't given E. P. Roe any space at all !' (1), '#him# His thirty unsigned novels began to pay him a few hundred francs , not 
 in cash , but in promissory notes ; so that he had to go still deeper into 
 debt .' (1), '#Balzac# de Berny gave Balzac money as she would have given it 
 to a son , and thereby she saved a great soul for literature .' (1), '#it# de Berny gave Balzac money as she would have given it 
 to a son , and thereby she saved a great soul for literature .' (1), '#us# What could be more 
 wonderful than his El Verdugo , which gives us a brief horror while 
 compelling our admiration ?' (1), '#her# Not only were there long 
 passages instinct with tenderness , and with his love for her ; but he 
 also gave her the most minute account of everything that occurred , and 
 that might interest her .' (1), '#him# Hanska , 
 he had another correspondent who signed herself " Louise , " but who never 
 let him know her name , though she wrote him many piquant , sunny letters , 
 which he so sadly needed .' (1), '#him# A teacher with 
 the appropriate name of Slatter set him hard tasks and caned him 
 unmercifully for every shortcoming .' (1), '#him# The fellowship at Magdalen was worth , at the outset , about twelve 
 hundred dollars annually , and it gave him possession of a suite of rooms 
 free of any charge .' (1), '#him# Publishers paid him large sums for everything he wrote .' (1)
